120,Us (2019),"The cast is first-rate, while the cinematography, framing, and editing all sensationally contribute to the supremely disconcerting ordeals."
121,Us (2019),The plot twists don't always add up and there are too many red herrings that create a sense of disappointment as Peele doesn't follow through.
122,Us (2019),"Peele's eagerly awaited second feature is here, and Us does not disappoint."
123,Us (2019),"With Us, another simplistic yet petrifying demonstration of the confrontational, Jordan Peele has announced himself as a master of horror."
124,Us (2019),An amazing ensemble effort.
125,Us (2019),"A masterly double life feature that shows a comparison between good/evil, light/darkness, beautiful/putrid, and dance/violence. [Full review in Spanish]"
126,Us (2019),"What Us demonstrates is that Jordan Peele is not a one-hit wonder. It's easy to compare him to cinematic greats like Hitchcock or Kubrick, but he's already established that he is in a league of his own."
127,Us (2019),"Taking too long to get there, Peele flubs an oddly inert home invasion when the family's maniacal scissor-wielding mirror images eventually show up. Basic jump scares abound, but there's no real terror."
128,Us (2019),Allegory seeps from every pore of the story and there's undeniable joy in untangling the myriad plot threads in the hours after the credits roll.
129,Us (2019),"Scenes and set pieces begin to drag on for too long and . . . wear thin, especially once you realize that they're simple diversions from the themes Peele is trying to address."
130,Us (2019),"The larger social commentary is timely, exposing the class divides of two parallel worlds. ... yet, the underlying metaphors never fully gel with the surface-level A-story plot, which is what ""Get Out"" did so well."
131,Us (2019),"This film bites with all of its teeth. It's an exercise in a certain level of brutality that we seem to reserve for those we know the best -- our family, our friends, our neighbors."
132,Us (2019),"Blood spluttered it may be, but Peele shows his worth twofold as a master of the psychological horror aficionado who is on to the path to greatness."
133,Us (2019),"When the best of the movie is put to the test, Peele turns the mirror back on ourselves to show how far we will go to protect things that are closest to us."
134,Us (2019),"Us soars as a survival horror film with touches of humor and a great lead performance. But in terms of subject matter, what it's trying to say gets a little lost in translation."
135,Us (2019),"Peele is turning into a unique, elite director whose vision integrates social commentary, terror and comedy like no one else. [Full review in Spanish]"
136,Us (2019),"There's a lot you can open up and analyze, but you can just watch it as a straight forward horror film too."

138,Us (2019),"Creepy, atmospheric, weird-as-balls doppelgänger horror."
139,Us (2019),"The story has a very Romero-esque quality to it, with its combination of isolating horror and situational humor, while his use of the camera has a style that simultaneously recalls both Hitchcock and Kubrick."

300,Citizen Kane (1941),"Way ahead of its time, Citizen Kane might probably be the greatest movie ever made. What young Orson Welles accomplishes in mere 2 hours is mind-blowing. [Full review in Spanish]"
301,Citizen Kane (1941),Citizen Kane was a cinematic achievement for its time...
302,Citizen Kane (1941),"Kane is unforgettable and his intense character study is a masterpiece of cinematic sublimity that is rarely, if ever, equaled."
303,Citizen Kane (1941),"The question of whether twenty-six-year-old Orson Welles is a genius or an accident seems to be settled for all time by his very first screen effort, written, produced, directed and acted by Welles himself."
304,Citizen Kane (1941),"This is a great picture, any way one looks at it. And it brings to the motion picture industry an exciting new personality -- Orson Welles, a man whose talents both as actor and director will be acclaimed by adult audiences far and wide."
305,Citizen Kane (1941),"The satire here is as savage as Swift's, and in its unrelenting light the victim becomes positively nauseous; yet the treatment is brilliant and continuously pleases the aesthetic sense."
306,Citizen Kane (1941),"[Citizen Kane] is a stirring, magnificent movie... It is always freshly conceived in that it uses the camera in ways that have not been seen exactly that way before."
307,Citizen Kane (1941),Welles is the most exciting thing that's happened since sound.
308,Citizen Kane (1941),Welles has shown Hollywood how to make movies.
309,Citizen Kane (1941),"Citizen Kane, written, produced, and directed by a young man of 25 whom America considers a genius, is an outstanding film, amazing in its presentation and vast in its conception."
310,Citizen Kane (1941),"Most people don't care about Kane's cutting edge techniques but there's so much more to admire, appreciate and enjoy about this cinematic edifice."
311,Citizen Kane (1941),"The realism, the development of the scenes, and the connection that is established so that the public doesn't lose the thread of the narrative is something truly extraordinary that we have not seen before. [Full Review in Spanish]"
312,Citizen Kane (1941),"It proves Welles' restless, reckless genius -- as exasperating as it is fascinating -- is triumphant in the new medium as it was in the old ones of theater and radio."
313,Citizen Kane (1941),"A film in which every minute is planned, everything works, not a second wasted, not a frame too much; stripped to the gears and yet rich with cinematic decoration."
314,Citizen Kane (1941),There are few more endlessly engrossing character studies to be found in the history of the medium.
315,Citizen Kane (1941),Orson Welles was ahead of his time.
316,Citizen Kane (1941),"Welles almost creates a mise en abyme throughout Citizen Kane, inviting but ultimately refuting the tendency to want to reduce everything to one core sentimental genesis."
317,Citizen Kane (1941),"It is a triumph of the film, and proof of its solid value and of the sense of its director and all concerned, that a human touch is not lost. Sympathy for the preposterous Mr. Kane survives. Indeed, there is something about him which seems admirable."
318,Citizen Kane (1941),"The construction is deliberately episodic, and individual settings often appear to owe more to the modern conceptions of stage-technique than to the cinema. But the ingenuity with which the episodes are assembled sets a new level in film-construction."
319,Citizen Kane (1941),"Welles' performance is nothing less than astonishing. He begins as a youth of 21, goes through middle age to his death, and makes every moment believable in voice, walk, and gesture. Even in his love scenes is Welles effective."

538,BlacKkKlansman (2018),John David Washington is... an up-and-coming talent worth keeping an eye on.
539,BlacKkKlansman (2018),"Due in no small part to the daily horrors of the Trump presidency, Lee seems to have recaptured that spark that gave us the kind of scathingly frank commentary coupled with an intimate African American perspective invocative of Do the Right Thing"
540,Get Out (2017),"Kaluuya is exceptionally grounded (continuously tossing around genuinely inquisitive expressions), making the eerie situations more realistic and more humorous."
541,Get Out (2017),"Contains that third act twist that comes with smart horror movies. By the end, the audience was cheering and applauding..."
542,Get Out (2017),"Get Out is an achievement on a textual, metatextual, and subtextual level that is effectively a roadmap for filmmakers trying to build a political message into their genre fiction."
543,Get Out (2017),One of the best films of the year for 2017.
544,Get Out (2017),"Jordan Peele delivers the best movie of the decade thanks to masterful symbolism of American flag wardrobe, cell-phone justice, cotton-picking escapes and dialogue double meanings."
545,Get Out (2017),"They say ""a mind is a terrible thing to waste"" and in Jordan Peele's directorial debut, Get Out is certainly one of the most accomplished films of the year."
546,Get Out (2017),"It can work as a suspense thriller, a horror comedy, or as a launching point for a deeper social conversation."
547,Get Out (2017),"A surprising film that shows Peele's versatility as well as enormous creative potential as writer, producer and director. [Full review in Spanish]"
548,Get Out (2017),"Sharp and satirical, frustratingly topical and poignant, ""Get Out"" insightfully explores race in America while delivering a banger of a horror movie."
549,Get Out (2017),"The complexity, though, is reduced by caricaturing the Armitage family and their guests as unfeeling monsters[.]"
550,Get Out (2017),"Get Out is the kind of thriller that will crawl under your skin and worm its way into your brain, making you think about it long after it's over."
551,Get Out (2017),"The horror is effective because Peele, who is also a comedian, supports it with a social commentary that criticizes the most brutal veins of racism in current American society. [Full review in Spanish]"
552,Get Out (2017),I did think it was very interesting and I'm excited for Jordan Peele to make more movies.
553,Get Out (2017),I liked it for what it was... I was entertained.
554,Get Out (2017),"Get Out is so damn smart, funny, and impressively directed by Peele, who embraces certain great horror tropes, but never forgetting that the best horror and sci-fi often includes clandestine messages and commentary on modern society."
555,Get Out (2017),Jordan Peele takes us on a frustrating yet ultimately victorious ride with his race-based mystery horror movie. Get Out combines genuine thrills with a no-holds-barred critique of black-white relations.
556,Get Out (2017),"Peele seduces, subverts and manipulates audience expectations - as the masters Alfred Hitchcock, John Carpenter, and Stanley Kubrick did before him."
557,Get Out (2017),"It's tense, angry, hilarious, and here in Trump's America, it might as well be a protest film."
558,Get Out (2017),"Get Out isn't a great film because of its excellent pacing, strongly defined characters, and mastery of tone. It's a great film because it never loses sight of its concept."
559,Get Out (2017),"...it'll be with us years later as shattered pieces from its fall, making sense for the future of how we talk about racism, and the human monster that hides within it."

600,The Irishman (2019),Little more than an excuse to get the band back together.
601,The Irishman (2019),"Perhaps Martin Scorsese's most ambitious work, this biopic of reputed union leader and mob hitman Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) has a narrative sweep that immediately grabs the viewer and refuses to let them go."
602,The Irishman (2019),"Well, objectively, the film is kind of boring."
603,The Irishman (2019),"I saw The Irishman in a huge theater on a giant screen, and I did not want to get up, didn't want it to end, and could have watched another hour of it if there was one."
604,The Irishman (2019),A film that seems like typical Scorsese until it doesn't seem like typical Scorsese anymore.
605,The Irishman (2019),"Reiterating my love of Scorsese, it's his ability to experiment that makes him a compelling director. Every film he directs is worth the time, and The Irishman lives up to that billing."
606,The Irishman (2019),"The Irishman is Scorsese working with what he knows best to express a new level of maturity, ruminating on the significance of legacy and what it means to live with the decisions that you have made along the way."
607,The Irishman (2019),"A titanic, towering crime drama with a tangled narrative web to fit its epic runtime. It's pure cinema as only a maestro like Scorsese can deliver."
608,The Irishman (2019),It's an amazing film that caps off a stunning career in film that spans over 50 years.
609,The Irishman (2019),"The great performances and incredible filmmaking make this fictionalized tale of Frank Sheeran a story to end the decade, one that has seen many changes within the film industry - and hopefully introducing a new era of Martin Scorsese."
610,The Irishman (2019),"Zaillian follows Scorsese; Scorsese follows himself; they both follow Brandt, whose end goal is nothing if not ephemeral. The disconnect shouldn't work, but here it's the crux."
611,The Irishman (2019),"A 3 1/2 hour epic that is in many ways the antithesis of ""Goodfellas,"" featuring many of Scorsese's auteur signatures but presented in a quiet, mournful tone asking if the gangster life was really worth it."
612,The Irishman (2019),"A paradoxical, melancholic but thoughtful and engaging film, well directed by Scorsese."
613,The Irishman (2019),Scorsese rewards patience with a third act you won't forget. [Full review in Spanish]
614,The Irishman (2019),"The Irishman is not just a mob movie. It's an examination of aging, regret, and holding value in the things that really matter."
615,The Irishman (2019),I'm trying to hide the impact it has caused me. It's a monumental work on the decline of the American gangster. [Full review in Spanish]
616,The Irishman (2019),"Despite mediocre visual de-aging effects, and unnecessarily long run time, The Irishman is an impeccable tale of life, regrets, betrayal and friendship. I'd hardly call this a masterpiece for Scorsese but this felt like a film he could do in his sleep."
617,The Irishman (2019),"The very definition of a late-period masterwork, this reckoning with a quarter-century of American corruption and damnation touches upon historical and fanciful milestones as if they were the stations of an inverted cross."
618,The Irishman (2019),"Extraordinarily ambitious, dealing with the biggest questions: death, and the attempt to work it out. To watch this figuring-out is a devastating privilege and the film a monumental artistic achievement."
619,The Irishman (2019),Surely only a filmmaker with plenty of life behind him - and plenty of such stories - could make a film so entertaining and yet so solemn and sad.
620,The Irishman (2019),Little more than an excuse to get the band back together.

660,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),Less a remake and more a reinvention of Miller's own postapocalyptic action movie genre.
661,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"Although it's cold, violent and visceral you can also feel the underlying elements of hope, loyalty, reverence and redemption."
662,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),Fury Road is a masterpiece of mayhem which cemented Charlize Theron as one of the greatest modern action stars and there's no experience quite like it.
663,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"This is exactly the type of grand cinematic spectacle brimming with passionate, zealous ideas that's been sorely lacking from the mechanical operations of formulaic tent poles."
664,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),Films like Mad Max: Fury Road do not come along often. Director George Miller delivers an epic and visual cinema art film that celebrates survival and hope in a bleak and deranged universe.
665,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"Wall-to-wall visceral action, insane practical stunts, highly stylized production, with a thoughtful take on the apocalypse."
666,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"Fury Road is the literal definition of controlled chaos. It's an amazing, full-tilt assault on the senses ... the most brilliant piece of mayhem to ever hit the screen."
667,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"In addition to being furiously entertaining and having new protagonists, watching this blockbuster is like going to the desert to see a special show by Monster truck, Slipknot and Cirque du Soleil. [Full review in Spanish]"

669,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"It was great. I mean, this is how to do an action movie."
670,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"Mad Max: Fury Road will be the film to beat for a long time coming, and the new high-water mark against which to judge action and blockbuster filmmaking. This is, quite simply, how it's done."
671,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"It's a rare film that engages the mind while rocking the body. Miller's vision of a world consumed by its own greed, where water, gasoline, and bullets are the most precious commodities, seems even more relevant today than it did 30 years ago."
672,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),As close to riding a rollercoaster you can experience while sitting in a movie theater.
673,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),The entirety is a delicious assault on both your visual cortex and auditory system - a giant orchestral blend of machine engines roaring and wheels peeling combined with a booming overture of drums and guitar.
674,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"Furiosa and the women are the heart and soul of Fury Road, championing female life and autonomy into something that could have easily been a popcorn flick for bros."

676,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"It's something awesome. It's all hot orange and brown, the glamour of the punishing desert wind, it is completely OTT and it can't go five minutes without an explosion and I loved it."
677,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"Miller's magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass. It's evidence that all-out action need not be reduced to ""dumb fun."" It's brilliant. It's glorious. It is Maxcellent."
678,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"Fury Road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel, but Miller plants seeds of bolder, more incendiary ideas within the bro-fantasy."

718,Mad Max: Fury Road (2015),"Fury Road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel, but Miller plants seeds of bolder, more incendiary ideas within the bro-fantasy."

883,Moonlight (2016),"Right from the beginning, Moonlight makes its impact known. You're watching a reaffirmation of black culture by telling it from a different perspective and understanding."
884,Moonlight (2016),To not understand the life depicted here is to not have humanity.
885,Moonlight (2016),"The dialogue is exquisite, but the most powerful moments come from silence... intimate moments to reflect and comprehend Chiron's reality. [Full review in Spanish]"
886,Moonlight (2016),"Unique and universal, bleak and hopeful, compassionate and humane, Moonlight eschews ordinary answers, constructs, and definitions."
887,Moonlight (2016),"Relying on intensely naturalistic performances and situations, it somehow manages to smuggle in moments of interior lyricism without breaking the flow of the film[.]"
888,Moonlight (2016),It's the social commentary on an intimately sincere human reality. [Full review in Spanish]
889,Moonlight (2016),It's very good.
890,Moonlight (2016),"A less pretentious, more poignant and powerful Boyhood."
891,Moonlight (2016),The fact that Moonlight as a film even exists is impressive; but that it's as near-perfect a film as you'll see all year is miraculous.
892,Moonlight (2016),Jenkins boils a life down to its decisive moments; a life in three parts is an eloquent and acute summation with Nicholas Britell's heart-rending music underlining.
893,Moonlight (2016),"Ultimately, Moonlight is cinema that's vital and profound. If there is any way humanly possible to put this film in front of your eyeballs, you owe it to yourself to do so. This movie is why movies exist."
894,Moonlight (2016),"MOONLIGHT is not a portrait painted in broad brushstrokes, but a tapestry - any one strand can be admired for its own technique and qualities, but standing back to observe the whole is where the power lies."
895,Moonlight (2016),"Barry Jenkins' screenplay is beautiful in its simplicity, relying just as much on its stars' exceptional abilities to move the story along during moments of silence."
896,Moonlight (2016),Moonlight has tremendous value both as unflinching dissection of a long-standing problem in the community and for the depiction of a kid with few choices who is unable to rise above the obstacles in his path.
897,Moonlight (2016),"The film is largely about the physical and emotional violence that's done to Chiron that enmeshes him in silence, against the grain of the slim moments of inexplicable kindness that break through to nurture him towards trust."
898,Moonlight (2016),"Beautiful, hopeful and captivating."
899,Moonlight (2016),"Moonlight managed to beautify an area considered horrifically ugly and scarred. The movie also brilliantly tackled black masculinity, crack addiction and bullying with an honest and fresh approach."

914,A Star Is Born (2018),"This new remake of A Star Is Born is somewhat predictable, because, in effect, the back story is the same, but the plot moves with the great chemistry exhibited by Lady Gaga and Cooper himself. [Full review in Spanish]"
915,A Star Is Born (2018),Star is Born is a tour de force directorial debut that channels Cooper's off-screen struggles with addiction and sobriety that vibes deeply personal and painfully honest.

960,Wonder Woman (2017),"The overuse of computer-augmented imagery and wirework and fully computer-animated characters makes everything look just a bit faker, especially during showdowns."
961,Wonder Woman (2017),Diana's a strong role model for young girls as she's a fighter and has no time for the typical gender roles placed in society.
962,Wonder Woman (2017),Gal Gadot is simply extraordinary.
963,Wonder Woman (2017),"Wonder Woman would have been a powerful statement just by its mere existence. Instead, we are treated to a definitive genre classic in its own right."
964,Wonder Woman (2017),Wonder Woman deserves the success and praise not just because the film is about an empowering female superhero that will undoubtedly inspire the younger generation and women alike - it's just a good film period.
965,Wonder Woman (2017),"Go see Wonder Woman solely for the fact that it's a fantastic, well made, exciting and emotional film. In fact, I can honestly say, without hyperbole, that this is one of the best superhero movies ever."
966,Wonder Woman (2017),"Wonder Woman is not only the depiction of a powerful woman that men and women alike needs to see, it's a metaphor for ourselves as well. It's a win for a comic movie universe that very much needed one."
967,Wonder Woman (2017),"Excellent character development, funny moments and epic action scenes. Jenkins did it: she created the first great film in the DC Extended Universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
968,Wonder Woman (2017),This film is full of 'fish-out-of-water' humour which comes from a demi-god negotiating the world of men. It is also visually stunning and the action scenes are thrilling - coupling the world of superheroes with WWI works surprisingly well.
969,Wonder Woman (2017),"Wonder Woman is a flawed superhero origin story. With that out of the way, the good news is it's mostly awesome, brings one of the greatest comic book characters ever to the big screen, and breaks up the boys' club that is contemporary superhero cinema."
970,Wonder Woman (2017),"Although it has a charismatic role from Gal Gadot, it has nothing exciting for two hours that turns wonderful to yawn. [Full review in Spanish]"
971,Wonder Woman (2017),It was totally entertaining. I'm excited to see more of these movies.
972,Wonder Woman (2017),Part of what I really liked about this movie was that it focused on her as a character and a human being.
973,Wonder Woman (2017),"Judged on equal footing as all other superhero films, as it and all movies should be, this is a terrific action film, a sly take on gender politics of the early 1900s, and a wonderfully crafted antiwar picture."
974,Wonder Woman (2017),... the directing by Patty Jenkins who shows that she can take a good script and turn out great scenes and coherence. Her way of directing works fantastically well with lead Gal Gadot's interpretation of Wonder Woman.
975,Wonder Woman (2017),"Wonder Woman stands proudly on its own, and a frankly astonishing sequence of Diana crossing No Man's Land alone pushes a fun blockbuster directly into iconic territory."
976,Wonder Woman (2017),"At least, finally the DCCU seems willing to learn from its mistakes and improve over previous entries."
977,Wonder Woman (2017),"Gal Gadot's performance is fantastic to watch, she not only carries the entire film, but she also brings strength, intelligence, compassion and beauty to her role."
978,Wonder Woman (2017),"Making the Hero with a Thousand Faces a woman proves the primal power of the oldest story by opening it up to half the world. After untold thousands of years, it still works."
979,Wonder Woman (2017),"Jenkins' Diana is vulnerable but strong, compassionate but fierce, good-hearted but no pushover. This film is a solid springboard for Diana to be fleshed out in further instalments."

1063,Dunkirk (2017),"Its structural experimentation makes it one of Nolan's most intense, incisive and emotionally engaging works."
1064,Dunkirk (2017),"Christopher Nolan recreates the World War II evacuation of Dunkirk by fracturing the narrative across three overlapping timelines: an hour in the air with Tom Hardy, a day at sea with Mark Rylance, and a week on shore with Kenneth Branagh."
1065,Dunkirk (2017),"Dunkirk is more than just a war film. You're watching a survival horror film, a psychologically, relentless suspense trip that Hitchcock would be proud of. It results in a film that leaves you breathless."
1066,Dunkirk (2017),"In style and execution, [Christopher Nolan] has made not just one of his very best works, and not only one of the best films of the year - Dunkirk is one of the best war films of the decade."
1067,Dunkirk (2017),"Even with the loud sound atmosphere, the lack of storytelling will get you yawning. [Full review in Spanish]"

1071,Dunkirk (2017),"As a technical achievement, I'd certainly give the framework high praise, but as an instrument in delivering high drama, I'm less than convinced. This is still very much a recommendation."
1072,Dunkirk (2017),"The marriage of performance, sound, structure, and downright astonishing visuals makes Dunkirk the ultimate moviegoing experience."
1073,Dunkirk (2017),"There is nothing clinical about it, just good old-fashioned elbow grease filmmaking. Sometimes, it's all it takes."
1074,Dunkirk (2017),"By bringing Dunkirk in at a brisk (for him) 106 minutes, Nolan rediscovers his gift for concision that made his early gems like Memento so pleasing."
1075,Dunkirk (2017),[O]ne of the most captivating and compelling films of the year so far.
1076,Dunkirk (2017),"With a dedication to excellent ""show don't tell"" presentation, stunning cinematography and a downright scary soundtrack and score, Dunkirk succeeds at putting viewers in the thick of an unsung but no less dark time of the Second World War."
1077,Dunkirk (2017),"A lofty divorce from Nolan's usual genre oriented flavor, this plays best as a multi-perspective experience of survival and rescue rather than a character driven ensemble as suggested by its cast."
1078,Dunkirk (2017),"Nolan has managed to make a masterpiece in a genre crowded with masterpieces, one that will likely be held up as one of the best ever about World War II."

1092,Inside Out (2015),"The usual brilliant animation by Pixar and great voice acting by the likes of Mindy Kaling, Lewis Black, and Diane Lane just make this unusual film that much better."
1093,Inside Out (2015),"[T]he writing is intelligent and clever, filled with witticisms and tongue-in-cheek double entendres...Combining story and visuals, there are more than enough elements of wackiness to keep a perpetual smile on your face."
1094,Inside Out (2015),"Well voiced, multi-layered, fearless, gorgeous, and inventive."
1095,Inside Out (2015),"Three of the last four Pixar movies have been sequels. Perhaps the expectation that this original idea would be up to par with their excellent past was simply too lofty. Look at me, I feel something other than Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger or Fear."

1560,Roma (2018),"The subjects are incredibly un-cinematic, as his camera documents - in a somewhat documentarian style - the lives and lifestyles of painfully average people."
1561,Roma (2018),"Aesthetically, the film is gorgeous. Cuaron has an attention for detail that other filmmakers should study."
1562,Roma (2018),Transcendent.
1563,Roma (2018),Perhaps the true mastery of the film is that it never actually feels like a masterpiece.

1565,Roma (2018),"A slow-burn film that recalls the Italian Neorealist movement. The goal is a slice-of-life character study rather than plot twists, but if you flip your mental switch, it's a subtly enveloping film that elicits nostalgia."
1566,Roma (2018),"The result is the most novelistic and experiential offering yet for [Cuarón], but make no mistake: Roma is not a film of gimmicks."
1567,Roma (2018),"Cuarón has a crafted something that is purely, assuredly human."
1568,Roma (2018),"It doesn't happen often, but sometimes as a film critic you exit a film so extraordinary and emotionally stirring that words nearly fail you. Writer/director/cinematographer/co-editor Alfonso Cuarón's deeply personal work Roma is just such an experience."

1570,Roma (2018),"Gorgeous and formally flawless, the director's precision and meticulous craft is unmatched, and his deep, personal connection to the story readily shines through. Roma is all of these things, but it also left me absolutely cold."
1571,Roma (2018),"It's a beautiful, emotional, human film, without music, which recreates an era with great aesthetic meticulousness and dissects the inequalities between social classes in a particular period of Mexican sociopolitical history. [Full review in Spanish]"
1572,Roma (2018),"In Cuarón's films, cinema conjures up its own world, and this one provides the chance to explore it with him more intimately than ever before."
1573,Roma (2018),"The movie's distance here works against it, emphasizing its outsider's view of what it frames as lower-class concerns. Instead of lending her character dimensionality, Cleo's tribulations begin to feel cartoonishly grim."
1574,Roma (2018),"Roma is intimate, epic and female-focused, not unlike filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron's 2013 intergalactic 3-D odyssey Gravity... But Roma is also an immersive nostalgic valentine to his '70s childhood in Mexico City."
1575,Roma (2018),"Fundamentally, it's a character piece about Chloe. Aparicio's placid, yet expressive face sometimes recalls Renée Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc. Hers is a brilliant, unmannered performance."
1576,Roma (2018),Alfonso Cuarón's most masterful film contains multitudes.
1577,Roma (2018),"By paying homage to his childhood, [Cuarón] has created a simple yet jaw-droppingly beautiful film that can only be seen as one thing: a visual masterpiece."
1578,Roma (2018),"The surround system is equally sublime, simulating action not seen on the screen, giving the film a transportive, immersive feel."
1579,Roma (2018),This is less a plot-driven film than a cinematic experience of being transported back in space and time. To a place in memory where anything can still be a marvel and the ordinary is sacred.

1587,Roma (2018),"Cuarón has a crafted something that is purely, assuredly human."
1588,Roma (2018),"It doesn't happen often, but sometimes as a film critic you exit a film so extraordinary and emotionally stirring that words nearly fail you. Writer/director/cinematographer/co-editor Alfonso Cuarón's deeply personal work Roma is just such an experience."
1589,Roma (2018),"Each moment, each dialogue build toward something very special, and then, the movie takes your head, looks you in the eyes and inspects your soul. [Full review in Spanish]"
1590,Roma (2018),"Gorgeous and formally flawless, the director's precision and meticulous craft is unmatched, and his deep, personal connection to the story readily shines through. Roma is all of these things, but it also left me absolutely cold."
1591,Roma (2018),"It's a beautiful, emotional, human film, without music, which recreates an era with great aesthetic meticulousness and dissects the inequalities between social classes in a particular period of Mexican sociopolitical history. [Full review in Spanish]"
1592,Roma (2018),"In Cuarón's films, cinema conjures up its own world, and this one provides the chance to explore it with him more intimately than ever before."
1593,Roma (2018),"The movie's distance here works against it, emphasizing its outsider's view of what it frames as lower-class concerns. Instead of lending her character dimensionality, Cleo's tribulations begin to feel cartoonishly grim."
1594,Roma (2018),"Roma is intimate, epic and female-focused, not unlike filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron's 2013 intergalactic 3-D odyssey Gravity... But Roma is also an immersive nostalgic valentine to his '70s childhood in Mexico City."
1595,Roma (2018),"Fundamentally, it's a character piece about Chloe. Aparicio's placid, yet expressive face sometimes recalls Renée Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc. Hers is a brilliant, unmannered performance."
1596,Roma (2018),Alfonso Cuarón's most masterful film contains multitudes.
1597,Roma (2018),"By paying homage to his childhood, [Cuarón] has created a simple yet jaw-droppingly beautiful film that can only be seen as one thing: a visual masterpiece."
1598,Roma (2018),"The surround system is equally sublime, simulating action not seen on the screen, giving the film a transportive, immersive feel."
1599,Roma (2018),This is less a plot-driven film than a cinematic experience of being transported back in space and time. To a place in memory where anything can still be a marvel and the ordinary is sacred.
1600,Roma (2018),"The subjects are incredibly un-cinematic, as his camera documents - in a somewhat documentarian style - the lives and lifestyles of painfully average people."
1601,Roma (2018),"Aesthetically, the film is gorgeous. Cuaron has an attention for detail that other filmmakers should study."
1602,Roma (2018),Transcendent.
1603,Roma (2018),Perhaps the true mastery of the film is that it never actually feels like a masterpiece.
1604,Roma (2018),"Cuarón's work as a writer, director and cinematographer are beyond perfection. His use of chaos to create the ordinary are the work of a genius. [Full review in Spanish]"

1620,The Third Man (1949),"As a mystery, it is average - but as a darkly artistic approach to intrigue, it's masterful."
1621,The Third Man (1949),"The writing, the acting, the music, and the locations are so distinct and recognizable that they have become lodged in our consciousness."
1622,The Third Man (1949),"Seventy years on such sombreness seems timely, as does Harry Lime, Welles's deliciously elusive antihero."
1623,The Third Man (1949),"The astounding acting bit, it may turn out, is that contributed by Orson Welles. As the object of this chilling search, Welles for once is pulled back to the size of a gifted actor, a trick for which he and a lot of old Welles' admirers can thank Reed."
1624,The Third Man (1949),The music is as distinctive as the James Bond or Star Wars theme...
1625,The Third Man (1949),"This film is lively, always moving forward, constantly bubbling with mystery and suspicion and secrets, but the characters are always driving the film."
1626,The Third Man (1949),We're seduced out of caring for Greene's weary plot. Welles saves the film and destroys it.
1627,The Third Man (1949),"Krasker's camera reveals a dank, matte, defeated city - so dully vivid as to be a character unto itself - except that this Vienna becomes something altogether different seen at night or underground."
1628,The Third Man (1949),"By the very nature of its settings and story, there are occasional reminiscences of Lang and Hitchcock, but there is nothing borrowed or imitated. Stylistically, The Third Man is Reed's most impressive film."
1629,The Third Man (1949),"Welles was a still-ridiculously young 34 when he played Harry, but he was probably born sounding 56..."
1630,The Third Man (1949),"The bombed buildings, piles of rubble and their evocative shadows form a haunting backdrop to the outdoor scenes, particularly at night. ... Greene's talent for dialogue and suspense shine. [It] has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster."
1631,The Third Man (1949),"It's an exciting experience, dazzling and entertaining and thought-provoking."
1632,The Third Man (1949),"Reed and screenwriter Graham Greene let the story unfold slowly and deliberately, like the cigarette smoke that floats around the characters, and keep us guessing at every step."
1633,The Third Man (1949),"Like many, I have loved this thriller of conscience and betrayal most of my moviegoing life."
1634,The Third Man (1949),"What really makes the film sing, though, isn't the jaunty and iconic zither score by Anton Karas. It's the film's groundbreaking visual aesthetic, which combines noir tropes with expressionism to create a visual wonderland of living shadows."
1635,The Third Man (1949),"This is a film which does away with such cretinous inanity as offering up goodies and baddies, instead presenting its cast of characters as doing things which they believe to be good, but are not seen as such through the eyes of observers."
1636,The Third Man (1949),"""The Third Man"" is important not just because of its technique but because of its theme ..."
1637,The Third Man (1949),Few films more effectively capture the crumbling infrastructure and opportunistic lawlessness of postwar Europe. And none better translate the snaking treachery of Graham Greene's stories and his worlds of cynical expats and casual betrayal.
1638,The Third Man (1949),"Set in postwar occupied Vienna, the plot is a corker, littered with memorable moments and played to perfection by an unforgettable cast that's led with distinction by Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten."

1745,Thor: Ragnarok (2017),Finally a live adaptation of Thor that's actually worth your time!
1746,Thor: Ragnarok (2017),"irected by New Zealand's Taika Waititi, it's the daftest movie from the comic book studio to date, shot through with the anarchically quirky humour in Waititi's films like What We Do in the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Boy."

1800,The Shape of Water (2017),The story falls into a pattern of contrived confrontations that culminates in an underwhelming union.
1801,The Shape of Water (2017),"Del Toro's story is built on a beautiful landscape brought to life by production design master Paul Austerberry and Dan Laustner, whose cinematography paints a pulpy noir coat of paint on a tumultuous period in American history."

1860,Selma (2014),"Wisely uses affective montages, orchestral music, tight pacing, and award-worthy acting to supplement the intense recreations of iconic undertakings."
1861,Selma (2014),Truly a film that must be seen by today's youth so that we can keep Selma and Ferguson from happening in the future.
1862,Selma (2014),"Selma is worthy of my highest recommendation. Hopefully like me, you'll clap once the end credits roll."
1863,Selma (2014),"The acting is exquisite, and DuVernay directs with a sure and confident hand. It's not only the story of Martin Luther King Jr.; it's the story of the American People."
1864,Selma (2014),"Leaves audiences moved and shaken; this is a movie that will resonate and be remembered for a very, very long time."
1865,Selma (2014),"In bringing together the personal, the political, and the historic, DuVernay has crafted a film that will be remembered and studied for years to come."
1866,Selma (2014),"...offering not only a superbly-realized presentation of a particular series of events, but also a sense of what it meant to live through the historical period in question."
1867,Selma (2014),It's the weight of history that gives Selma so much emotional heft.
1868,Selma (2014),"...[I]n zooming in on one moment, director DuVernay and writer Paul Webb really force us to live in the trial by fire that was the American South in 1965."
1869,Selma (2014),"As director, DuVernay employs a style of storytelling... that makes it possible for audiences to find the film engrossing, entertaining, and educational."

1873,Selma (2014),A very satisfying picture.

1875,Selma (2014),"Selma's cultural significance is critical and will inevitably permeate all conversations about the film. As a reviewer, I must stress that its cinematic value speaks for itself, even when you swipe away the context of today's struggles."
1876,Selma (2014),"Selma serves as a pointed and poignant riposte to our current historical moment. It's an important film about an important story. It deserves to be seen, shared, discussed, and, like the events it depicts, never forgotten."
1877,Selma (2014),What makes Selma a truly fine film is the imagery we see.
1878,Selma (2014),"Director Ava DuVernay has crafted an impressive film that doesn't just chronicle the events in Selma, but serves as an impressive portrait of King both as a leader in the civil rights movement and a flawed family man."

2132,Arrival (2016),"Arrival has aliens in it, but it's not a movie about aliens. It will challenge you with its complex plot and its ideas about life, death, communication and the nature of time. It is very much worth seeing."

2140,Arrival (2016),"If there was such a precedent, this film might be considered an alien encounter procedural."
2141,Arrival (2016),"Arrival expertly uses conventions of the genre to explore free-will, experiences and memory, in a film that is as personal as it is relatable."
2142,Arrival (2016),"A film as comfortable with universe-twisting ideologies as it is with the intimate, perhaps universal, experiences of communication, grief, discovery and trust."

2220,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),"The film may not possess the emotional impact of Disney's later animated classics, but it's nevertheless a fascinating historical milestone in animation."
2221,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),"Good, but should have been better..."
2222,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),Snow White and the Seven Dwarves is undeniably a watershed in animation and a truly classic film. How he adapted the story is a topic that has been critiqued and debated with almost as much passion as the original folktale.
2223,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),Kids will like the film most because of the Dwarfs' hilarious antics. Grown-ups because they will think they're kids again.
2224,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),"Walt Disney, without losing any of the story's fairy-tale quality, has made it into a picture that can turn the most casehardened adult into a wide-eyed four-year-old."

2226,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),Such a quixotic undertaking in historical context that it was obviously made by someone with something to prove.

2228,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs may not be the best example of a Disney classic, thanks mainly to its lightly-plotted story, but with great animation, memorable characters, and beautiful music, it still remains one of their most endearing films."
2229,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),"Some early sequences seem a tad uncertain, but a little way in all becomes surer of itself and, for now going on eighty years ago, a miracle."
2230,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937),The film is as charming as it is novel in conception and execution and it is so bound to appeal as strongly to grown-ups as to youngsters.

2280,Logan (2017),"It doesn't help that the villain is ridiculous, especially as he manages invincibility in the face of Wolverine's inseparable weaponry."
2281,Logan (2017),...not just another superhero movie...
2282,Logan (2017),"James Mangold keeps the movie as grounded in realism as possible. Unlike the other films in the franchises, it doesn't feel overly CGI and effects heavy."
2283,Logan (2017),"A dark, fascinating character study that treats its characters with an intelligence and maturity that has been lacking in the X-Men films practically since their inception."
2284,Logan (2017),Logan is just about everything you could possibly want from a film that is said to be the end of the road for both Jackman and Stewart.
2285,Logan (2017),Not only is this film superb but serves as a fantastic and fitting end to Marvel's celebrated character.
2286,Logan (2017),"Brash and pulpy, desolate but hopeful, violent and touching, Logan is a fitting culmination of the Wolverine saga."
2287,Logan (2017),"Jackman portrays Wolverine with a hint of drama that seems trustworthy, but along the way his latest journey becomes boring, repetitive, with ephemeral pleasurable moments ending in a cheeky climax trying to be sentimental. [Full review in Spanish]"
2288,Logan (2017),This is probably the best superhero movie I've seen in years.
2289,Logan (2017),The thing that I liked the most about it was that it was a human story.
2290,Logan (2017),"Logan works best if you have a history with the Wolverine character, but it's also remarkably impactful as a standalone film."
2291,Logan (2017),Logan is a solid ending for its title character and could easily be a high point for the X-Men series or a solid high to end on.
2292,Logan (2017),"Logan is a powerful, excellent film - a fitting farewell to what turned out to be one (or two) of the most enduring character portrayals in film history."
2293,Logan (2017),"When presented with a superior script, the cast stepped up."
2294,Logan (2017),"LOGAN is the best use of a superhero property in years by doing what so many neglect to do - tell a story, and tell it well. If this film is to be the final appearance of Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart then they truly have left on a high."
2295,Logan (2017),"Logan elevates itself beyond superhero tropes by examining the man well known for his healing ability, sharp claws, and short temper through themes of finality and family."
2296,Logan (2017),Logan is the tenth X-Men movie . . . and might just be the best.
2297,Logan (2017),"Stewart and Jackman give a pair of brilliant performances, and Keen shows dazzling range for a girl younger than the franchise itself."
2298,Logan (2017),Podcast Review
2299,Logan (2017),"The ending of ""Logan""... works in a bold and poignant way, providing the kind of closure that any story could be proud of."

2460,The Favourite (2018),"Lanthimos once again opts to inject bizarreness for the sake of bizarreness, at a great detriment to both artistry and entertainment value."
2461,The Favourite (2018),One of the best and most unique films of the year...
2462,The Favourite (2018),"Yorgos Lanthimos... brings his singularly off-kilter vision to English history to produce a film that is eye-opening and eye-popping, and not a little subversive."
2463,The Favourite (2018),A strongly acted costume drama that is completely brazen in its execution in the best possible ways.
2464,The Favourite (2018),"The easiest to watch, and at the same time the most complex of Lanthimos productions [Full Review in Spanish]"
2465,The Favourite (2018),"I laughed heartily, cringed often, giggled like a schoolboy, blushed a little, and just had a really good time watching this film."
2466,The Favourite (2018),The Favourite shows us a perfection addict Yorgos Lanthimos. A filmmaker with enough maturity to transmit the most raw feelings of human reality accompanied by satire. [Full review in Spanish]
2467,The Favourite (2018),"Did you like or despise ""The Lobster?"" That answer will shape your opinion of ""The Favourite"" by Yorgos Lanthimos, whose international reputation precedes him, but whose signature style of absurdist black comedy is not my cup of tea."

2474,The Favourite (2018),"One hell of a gleeful, devilish, wit-riddled ride. Lanthimos delivers a stylish, scrupulous period piece that toys with convention and provides hilarious highs and soul-crushing lows,"
2475,The Favourite (2018),"It has left me stunned with the visual baroqueness that I witness in its staging and in some masterful performances from Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone and, especially, Olivia Colman as Queen Ana. [Full review in Spanish]"
2476,The Favourite (2018),"An inspired, cosmopolitan meeting of the Greek Weird Wave (director Lanthimos) and Australian Quirky Comedy (co-writer Tony McNamara)."
2477,The Favourite (2018),The film is much more saturated in the attitudes of the Catholic Church [...] and deals with this particularly 'Catholic' mix of issues that the story brings up.
2478,The Favourite (2018),A sharp look into the intimacies of Monarchy and its perks. As funny and tragic as it should be. [Full review in Spanish].
2479,The Favourite (2018),"It's a dark view, but dark views, like sunny views, have to come from somewhere. Where is Lanthimos's dark sun? I don't know, but I'll definitely keep watching."
2480,The Favourite (2018),"Lanthimos once again opts to inject bizarreness for the sake of bizarreness, at a great detriment to both artistry and entertainment value."
2481,The Favourite (2018),One of the best and most unique films of the year...
2482,The Favourite (2018),"Yorgos Lanthimos... brings his singularly off-kilter vision to English history to produce a film that is eye-opening and eye-popping, and not a little subversive."
2483,The Favourite (2018),A strongly acted costume drama that is completely brazen in its execution in the best possible ways.
2484,The Favourite (2018),"The easiest to watch, and at the same time the most complex of Lanthimos productions [Full Review in Spanish]"
2485,The Favourite (2018),"I laughed heartily, cringed often, giggled like a schoolboy, blushed a little, and just had a really good time watching this film."
2486,The Favourite (2018),The Favourite shows us a perfection addict Yorgos Lanthimos. A filmmaker with enough maturity to transmit the most raw feelings of human reality accompanied by satire. [Full review in Spanish]
2487,The Favourite (2018),"Did you like or despise ""The Lobster?"" That answer will shape your opinion of ""The Favourite"" by Yorgos Lanthimos, whose international reputation precedes him, but whose signature style of absurdist black comedy is not my cup of tea."
2488,The Favourite (2018),The Favourite is wickedly hysterical in a near perfect film and a career-best for Yorgos Lanthimos.
2489,The Favourite (2018),"A comely comedy of manners, supported by a cast that knows when to go for scandalous laughs and when to play it straight."
2490,The Favourite (2018),"The Favourite marks [Lanthimos'] most dynamic work yet in its dissection of class structure and gender politics, doling out pity and hilarity with equal aplomb."
2491,The Favourite (2018),Olivia Colman puts in an award-winning performance in this hilarious bat-shit crazy picture which is by far Lanthimos at his uninhabited finest.
2492,The Favourite (2018),It's actually Colman who steals our attention for every second she's on screen... It's a big performance that is also incredibly nuanced and sublimely amusing.

2520,The Big Sick (2017),"The story beats may be traditional but the sensibility, and especially the jokes, are of the moment."
2521,The Big Sick (2017),"Refreshingly, it's almost as if the film wasn't designed to be a comedy; laughs are conjured naturally from everyday situations and uncomfortable interactions."
2522,The Big Sick (2017),Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon's real-life love story serves as inspiration for the film that put romantic comedies back on the map.
2523,The Big Sick (2017),"Kumail Nanjiani, Zoe Kazan, Ray Ramano and Holly Hunter are so funny that they yank the rom-com genre right out of a coma."

2526,The Big Sick (2017),"In some ways this love story feels old-fashioned - but it is also modern, by touching on Islamophobia. Nanjiani playing himself provides integrity and while there is high drama or perfect comedic timing at times, it is character-driven at its core."

2531,The Big Sick (2017),"The Big Sick is so funny, so smart, so heartfelt that it demands to be seen."
2532,The Big Sick (2017),"This is a comedy with real-life stakes that's not about being cruel to anyone. It's also a little shaggy and loose, which is excusable because the characters are so fun to be around."
2533,The Big Sick (2017),"If you're in the mood for a heartwarming romantic drama which manages to tackle some heavy themes, then The Big Sick might be right up your alley. Just don't expect Mamma Mia and you'll have a great time."

2536,The Big Sick (2017),Ray Romano and Holly Hunter as Emily's parents are the kinds of supporting performances that feel so much larger than they are because they control every minute of screen time they have.

2538,The Big Sick (2017),"The Big Sick is that rare film that reminds us, through both wry humor and understated poignancy, that life's most meaningful moments often occur when we veer off script."
2539,The Big Sick (2017),"By no means a perfect film, this often clunky and clumsy charmer is a love letter to our commonality; it is simultaneously an intimate story of romance and a mass-appeal to remember that we are all defined by variations on the same few themes."

2638,Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019),"Ultimately, Spider-Man: Far From Home is a fun, energetic, and entertaining blockbuster, and far better than what's been in cinemas these last two months."
2639,Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019),"This is an easygoing summer-movie trifle, make no mistake, and yet... In years to come, this may seem very much a movie of its era."
2640,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),"A parable and a fairy tale that speaks to the child in us all, and wishes that we could all be more like Elliot, and less like the grown-ups."

2642,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),"Like the spirits in Poltergeist, suspended between one state of consciousness and another, Spielberg hovers somewhere between childhood and adulthood, unable and unwilling to go over the other side. But then, where would the movie industry be if he did?"
2643,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),E.T. is a unique movie capable of captivating different audiences. [Full Review in Spanish]
2644,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),Spielberg's visual inventiveness in much of E.T. is of sufficiently high quality to make one regret those passages where he falls below his best.
2645,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),Some of the performances are part of the reason why it works so well... I can't think of a child actor that that pulls off such emotional depth.
2646,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),"This is a real movie, with all those elements that have proved sure-fire through history; Laughter, tears, involvement, thrills, wonderment. Steven Spielberg also adds a message: Human beings and spacelings should learn to co-exist."
2647,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),Director Steven Spielberg knew we'd all fall in love with E.T. for one very good reason: he embodies what we hope all aliens will be like when they finally visit our planet.
2648,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),"No matter how much time passes, E.T. will always be right here."
2649,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),Spielberg has crafted with warmth and humor a simple fantasy that works so superbly on so many levels that it will surely attract masses of moviegoers from all demographics.
2650,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),"Steven Spielberg's E. T., The Extra-Terrestrial is the best cinematic fairy tale since The Wizard of Oz."
2651,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),E.T. ...comes to a beleaguered industry like a gift from the gods. Not only does it get bums on seats but it encourages the kind of shared enjoyment that suggests the cinema still has something unique to offer.
2652,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),The marvel of this extraordinary movie is that it captures for even the most jaded grownup that pleasurable state of innocence and awe that only children are fortunate enough to experience.
2653,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),"Spielberg works well with children, but never before has he directed them with such reticence or such appreciation of their humor, intelligence and decency."
2654,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),It lifts you into its make-believe in the wonderfully enriching way that only movies can do. I wouldn't be surprised if 'E.T.' eventually turned into the kind of durable classic that can be revived indefinitely for future generations.
2655,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),"It's connection, its life, and it's about feelings of love that tends to transcend species and stars."
2656,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),"With a touching relationship at the core of its compelling narrative, along with a brilliant score and nostalgic special effects, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial remains one of director Steven Spielberg's most beloved films."
2657,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),"It's a fantastical adventure with a grounding in the modern (circa 1982) world of suburbia, divorce, and adolescent anxiety, and E.T. is the ultimate imaginary playmate come to life."
2658,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982),What makes the movie a masterpiece is the intensely visceral way in which Spielberg conveys these children feeling adult emotions for the first time.

2797,All About Eve (1950),"Joseph L. Mankiewicz' All About Eve is a rich, impeccably written, gunshot sharp black comedy about an aging actress, the go-getter who seeks to supplant her, and the heaping pile of carefully fostered artisanal bitchiness that they construct."

2800,All About Eve (1950),The kind of dialogue actors kill for.

2810,All About Eve (1950),"n a movie in which everyone is preoccupied with learning all about her character, she remains alluringly, dangerously unknowable."

2812,All About Eve (1950),"All About Eve ranks among the smartest comedy-dramas in many, many years."
2813,All About Eve (1950),"It is similar to a good many films that have gone before it, but Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who wrote and directed the picture, has been so ingenious in his treatment of the subject that he has come up with a thoroughly entertaining movie."

2821,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"There's something rotten in small-town, U.S.A., and Hitchcock chose Santa Rosa, California-one of the most picturesque cities in the nation-to set his tale of a modern-day wolf in sheep's clothing."
2822,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"Still reeling after having seen this film, I do not want to spoil a moment of it for anyone else. I can only tell you that it is a brilliant Alfred Hitchcock melodrama, set mainly in a leafy sunny American town -- and leave the story at that."
2823,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"To save studio materials, the film has been largely made in an actual Californian town and the gain is remarkable."
2824,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"As we say. it is a curtailed Hitchcock, but still recognizably the one who tops the lot in artful melodrama."
2825,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),A series of tense dramatic scenes superbly acted by Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright.
2826,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"Master of the suspense drama that he is, Hitchcock keeps his climax for the very end. When it comes it is terrific. The final curtain Is a glorious piece of cynicism."
2827,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"The movie may lack the show-off set pieces that Hitchcock turned into his trademark, yet its tension never falters."
2828,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"This is certainly one of Hitchcock's most satisfying thrillers, mostly thanks to Wright and Cotten's believable relationship."
2829,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"Shadow of a Doubt may or may not be Hitchcock's greatest film, but it's his most intimate and heart-wrenching."
2830,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"Eerie, disturbing thriller, with much to say about gender, feminism, the benefits of government and ""Love Thy Neighbor""."
2831,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),Derives its power from its stark simplicity.
2832,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"This thriller's horrible fascination lies in watching the strong-willed young lady's admiration of, fondness for, and idealization of a supposed gentleman clot and curdle. The plot's marred only by a slightly rushed and convenient ending."
2833,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"If the motives of filmmakers are revealed in the frames of their more obscure pictures, then 'Shadow of a Doubt' is a resounding testament to the power of Alfred Hitchcock's vast creative engine."
2834,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),Peels back the welcoming warmth and sincere innocence of small-town life to reveal the gullibility and the naïveté underneath; it's a fiction about the perpetuation of fictions.
2835,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"No one would ever accuse Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt of being plausible, but it is framed so distinctively in the Hitchcock style that it plays firmly and never breaks out of the story."
2836,Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"This Hitchcock masterpiece has the same general theme as his Suspicion -- the slow, terrible growth of fear of a loved one. But Shadow, from beginning to end, is a surpassingly better picture."

2880,The Kid (1921),"Every single one of Chaplin's features is a classic, but The Kid is his first, and one of his greatest in terms of personal progression and artistic ambition -- plus, one of the most emotionally heart-wrenching child performances ever put to celluloid."
2881,The Kid (1921),Formerly it was the custom to say that Mr. Chaplin played down to the level of his audiences. Now it is to be hoped that he will lift his audiences up to this new level of his own.
2882,The Kid (1921),The story is only of the average order... [but] the quality of the film lies in the joyous fooling of Chaplin and the Kid.
2883,The Kid (1921),"As ""the Kid,"" Jackie Coogan's acting is remarkable, while the mother is portrayed by Edna Purviance. Charlie Chaplin is just his inimitable self."
2884,The Kid (1921),"I'll wager one unclipped Liberty Bond against a dozen small, soggy doughnuts that it will give more people more enjoyment than any other picture they have ever seen in a motion picture theater."
2885,The Kid (1921),"Chaplin is, of course, hilarious, but it's Coogan's cherubic charm that makes this so special."
2886,The Kid (1921),[The Kid] has definitively cemented the actor's renown... in terms of his theatrical gifts. [Full review in Spanish]
2887,The Kid (1921),The Kid is a knockout.
2888,The Kid (1921),"Chaplin shares the screen with an exceptional performance by Coogan, who is just as effective with emotional manipulation through expressions alone."
2889,The Kid (1921),"The Kid is a vastly entertaining picture, but there are some things in it which, we believe, were better left unsaid. Why is it that Chaplin, who is really an idealist, always has touches of vulgarity in his pictures?"
2890,The Kid (1921),"The Kid (1921) is silent comic star Charlie Chaplin's classic of comedy and pathos - his first feature-length film (it was a more sophisticated six-reeler or ""6 Reels of Joy"" than his previous shorts)."
2891,The Kid (1921),"Chaplin claimed that, ""Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot."" And The Kid is quite possibly the best example of this aphorism."
2892,The Kid (1921),"Chaplin proved himself equally adept at tickling funny bones and pulling heartstrings, and his chemistry with young Jackie Coogan remains one of cinema's great onscreen pairings"
2893,The Kid (1921),To my mind The Kid is by long odds the best motion picture comedy ever made. It has more than humor; it has tenderness and literary charm. Incidentally it is the first child picture I ever saw that did not give me an acute pain to the bowels.
2894,The Kid (1921),"It was Chaplin's first full-length film, and the action is perhaps too episodic; he hadn't yet mastered the structural demands of the long form. But several of the episodes... are sublime."
2895,The Kid (1921),"The Kid, Charlie Chaplin's first feature-length production, is one of his most sentimental and most satisfying films, a simple but very effective blend of pathos and laughs, in which the Tramp finds an abandoned baby."
2896,The Kid (1921),"Clearly recalling his own troubled childhood in Victorian London, the film is remarkable for the chemistry between the Tramp and that window-smashing moppet Jackie Coogan."
2897,The Kid (1921),"Beyond its ability to wring the heart, The Kid of all Chaplin's pictures perhaps most manifests his extraordinary knowledge of life, which his sensitive perceptions and comic imagination use as the raw material for laughter."
2898,The Kid (1921),"The movie opens with the words ""a picture with a smile -- and perhaps, a tear,"" a mission statement that would serve Chaplin well over the ensuing decades."
