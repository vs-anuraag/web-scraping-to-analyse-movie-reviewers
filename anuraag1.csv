The most acclaimed element of the film the camera work, which is still to this day impressive. But it isn't just there to be flashy, it helps to tell the story. The shot of Kane walking through the mirrors might be the most depressing shot in history. The cinematography isn't the only innovative part of this film. The movie opens with the protagonist dying, and then his life is told in flashbacks, a revolutionary idea for 1941. The narrative structure and the cinematography are usually what is talked about in reviews of Citizen Kane (And they are amazing), but other aspects of the film are just as good. The performances from the mercury actors are all phenomenal, keep in mind they all had to age fifty years for their roles. The script (the only thing that won an Oscar) is also fantastic, the Bernstein monologue being one of the stand out moments. Bernard Herman's score is also great, I love the music that plays when reading Thacher's account of Kane's childhood and at the end of the film (I  won't spoil what it is showing in case you haven't seen it). Citizen Kane is as close to perfect as a film can get, if you haven't seen it watch it now!… Expand\n"", ""\nIt's absolutely one of those movies who you must watch before you die.

Also, the thesis is about how most of our wounds come from early childhood, the worst may come trying to prevent some other thing that was the worst, his mom sent him away to protect him from his dad, but regardless of that and wealth, Kane became injured all the same, like it was in his genes.  he was made narcissistic as a child, before he was sent away, the mom was clearly too beat down to love him and his dad was too angry to love him really.  it is very much a Freudian movie, interesting to consider if it was a Jungian movie it would be called 'Citizen Neo'… Expand\n"", '\nWonderful, marvelous, glorious, fabulous... this is Citizen Kane.

Directed and written by Orson Welles, who also gives life to the lead role, this film also has the participation of other players and is considered by many the best film ever made.First of all, its necessary to clarify one thing: despite the opinions of many people consider this movie the best ever, these considerations are ALWAYS subjective and likely to be discussed. Each person has the right to think of another way, like it or not, period. Now let's get down to business.When I saw this movie for the first time I was not able to understand or to see why it was so acclaimed by critics. Currently I'm most able to understand the reasons. The actors glittered in their roles, particularly Welles, who would become one of the film's biggest names in his time. The script is simple, but it tells a good story, which addresses such important issues as the simplicity and true happiness. Its a film made with love by those involved, where every detail has been thought and rethought. The use of non-linear narrative, through the use of constant flashbacks, allows the public to see the life of the deceased millionaire, a missing character, but always present. The scenarios are excellent and even the camera angles were thought innovatively. For all that, this film was considered a landmark. It doesn't have a history that goes stay forever in our memory, but it was a film that showed to the industry that certain narrative techniques, light, shooting etc. were truly possible.So, my advice is to forget the critics, specialists and experts. Forget that is an acclaimed film and see the movie, enjoy the film before you think about it.… Expand\n"", ""\nA classic among all classics.

But besidesFinally, I got to watch Citizen Kane, and there is no confusion about why this is commonly considered one of the greatest films of all-time. I watched many movies that have been described as ""Revolutionary""  and ""Game-changing"". But besides that Citizen Kane really deserve to be called so more than any movie I\'ve watched in my life, it\'s could be the oldest movie that is as influential as it is timeless. I felt I was watching a movie the has been released couple years ago, except it\'s shot in black and white. An ecstasy of light and shadow, of clashing textures and graphic forms. A haunting cinematography that makes Citizen Kane one of the best-looking movies to date. an exuberant use of camera placement and movement and inventive lighting. Yes, it\'s above all a visual achievement. But all these innovative techniques shouldn\'t be questioned whether they still hold up or not. Because they don\'t just hold up to this day, but they are as fresh and contemporary as they were in 1941. But all that is from the technical standpoint, so what about the screenplay, the narrative, the story?As Orson Welles took many risks directing Citizen Kane he also took risks writing it\'s Oscar-winning script with Herman J. Mankiewicz. And of course by risks I mean the unprecedented use of flashbacks, and the non-linear storytelling. And While I can\'t say this way of storytelling paid off perfectly, I have to admit that this structure has changes the game forever in film-making. It took me a while to be engaged with the characters, and the story itself. That\'s because the pacing was confusingly fast at the beginning, and some important aspects and details in the story needed to be more focused on. It also dragged, and almost lost me a couple of times. As I mentioned above, the build up for the titular character could\'ve been way better, at least to make me invested in the character from the start.With that being said, the more the time goes, the more I became engaged with the story, and invested in all the characters, not only Charles Kane. And I couldn\'t help but hope for some explanation about the fate of Kane. After some more minutes, I realized that Citizen Kane is a character study, actually, a very complex and compelling one. The story became more poignant and moving. By the way, if you still haven\'t watched Citizen Kane because you think it\'s a pretty serious and bleak film, you better watch it ASAP. Because it\'s actually funny! Yes, sometimes it\'s funny in a cynical way, but it is always a light-hearted movie, and easy to watch. But that doesn\'t mean it\'s a feel-good movie at all. As I mentioned, it the story becomes more touching and emotional as it proceeds, and it\'s represented in a flashback structure to reveal some mysteries about a publishing tycoon\'s rise and fall who dies corrupt and alone. So I think you get the point.All the performances are impeccable, and Orson Welles\' performance is as terrific as his direction. Also, Joseph Cotten is great as always. Also, the dialogue is so clever, and there are a fair share of very subtle lines.Citizen Kane is far from perfect, IMO. Nevertheless, it somehow lives up to its reputation as a landmark achievement in film. But what\'s striking now is how utterly modern it is in direction.

Greg Toland\'s""Citizen Kane"" is still topping the best movies of all time list of all respectable film connoisseurs. Orson Welles\' first feature film undeniably set a new bar for Hollywood and had a strong influence on film noir. Greg Toland\'s cinematography was ages ahead, particularly in his use of shadow, pan focus, and compositing to create depth, and the non-linear storytelling with multiple narrators was a significant innovation for the time. Part of the myth was also fueled by the controversy of its satire of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper tycoon who heavily influenced public opinion on the Spanish–American War.Still, it\'s undeniable that cinema has been evolving and improving ever since, and that the historical value aside ""Citizen Kane"" is far from being the best film ever. The writing is solid indeed, but the story is static and lacks tension, development, and any kind of emotional impact, offering little more than some sociopolitical reflections on the rise and fall of a fascinatingly ambiguous character. Welles also seems to purposedly keep Kane\'s figure as distant as possible to redirect our empathy towards the other characters. It kinds of bothered me that we never get to see real inner conflicts or even crucial moments of his life like the death of his son and parents (only briefly mentioned in ""The News on the March""). It\'s almost as Welles purposedly wanted to keep us distant from the character and redirect the empathy towards the other characters\' roles as unreliable narrators.No one can deny that it still looks terrific for a film almost 80 years old, though. Just think of the uncanny opening sequence that leads to Kane\'s death, the journalist\'s visit to Thatcher\'s archive, or Kane\'s self-confinement in the Xanadu gilded cage. As the rooms get bigger and bigger, Kane is surrounded by fewer and fewer people until he is completely alone dreaming of his parents\' boarding house.… Expand\n']"

I first thought he was Italian, and I was surprised how un-italian he was prior to his role. So good, that he would adopt this speech into his everyday talk for the rest of his life. That man was a legend. Pair him up of Al Pacino, who was a budding star, and now legend (though he has plateaued ever since Scent of a Woman, when he won an Oscar for saying Huah!, when it really should've been for this role, or as Tony Montana in Scarface, in Dog Day Afternoon, in Carlito's Way, or other). Pacino is startling brilliant as a seemingly normal young man who reluctantly joins the mafia, but then takes over the family business and runs it like his own after it was passed down from Brando. James Cahn was absolutely phenomenal as the hotheaded Sonny Corleone, and Jon Cazale as the weak-minded brother Fredo. This movie changed the gangsta movie landscape giving a third dimension to previous cop-bad guy, go kill movies, and really gives an insight of what they are about, that being loyalty, trust, bonding, and later turns into power, corruption, greed, and eventually the downfall of Michael Corleone.

And I think it is his supervision that blends in sacrifice in romance, so pure and irreplaceable, that drama is overshadowed by its crowd pleasing concept.

But the final act is brimmed with charm, so where they actually had to work was the introduction. And choreographed like some exotic dance, the entire hotel that is mapped out in front of us, makes us feel like home something that has aged well over the years. Personally, I prefer the sacrifice of his hotel's fairness regarding the gambling policies.To me, that would always be the game changer, not only the actress's performance but the tone that shifts with such calculative baby steps that you are sinking in deliberately in those twinkling eyes. And if Bogart is boasting off with some of his best work then Ingrid Bergman definitely casts the magic powerful enough to rubble him down in a blink.

But it could just as well hold the name of another picture currently running in cinemas: Life Itself. That simple yet profound thing is what lies at the core of Richard Linklater’s unique 12-year-spanning story and makes it relatable for everyone, regardless of sex, age group, descent, social status, or character. Linklater lets his audience live through the fun and the pain, the love and the misery, and the excitement and the disappointment of his protagonist Mason with yet another wonderful screenplay in his repertoire and an unspectacular but still extraordinary way of directing. Leaving the cinema, it’s hard to grasp one has just spent the better part of an evening in front of a screen, but at the same time, there’s also a feeling of having relived your own adolescence along with Mason.… Expand\n', ""\nI was expecting a sort of emotional roller coaster with moments of empathy, sadness, joy, etc. -- having gone through real-life boyhood myself -- but rarely did this film evoke that kind of personal attachment and investment for me.\rEsquireI was expecting a sort of emotional roller coaster with moments of empathy, sadness, joy, etc. -- having gone through real-life boyhood myself -- but rarely did this film evoke that kind of personal attachment and investment for me.\rEsquire has a Q&A with Linklater and Hawk in their latest issue, and in it they claim to have made a conscious effort to avoid cliches, but somehow they landed on a bunch of them anyway.\rThere are a few great moments, and generally very few missteps, but ultimately this film does not reach the upper echelons of movie lore.

See This Boy\'s Life.\rWant to see Ethan Hawke\'s best? See Predestination.\rWant to save 3 hours? Skip Boyhood.\r I loved Before Sunset, Sunrise, and Midnight. But Boyhood is not good.\r DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE.\r Boyhood gets attention for the gimmick of being filmed sporadically over 12 years, so you get to see the kids in the movie grow up. Big whoop. Not an ounce of Hollywood gloss here. The movie goes for realism in the extreme. Homes are dirty, kind of crappy and depressing. It also passes over obvious places other movies would go; it skips cliches. No the step dad does not try to sexually abuse his step daughter. Which was a breath of fresh air. But it also crosses a line of being too realistic in terms of having no real plot. For awhile there IS kind of a plot as the mother deals with a difficult domestic drama. But after that the film sprawls. Example. The dad (minor spoiler, nothing big; probably you\'ll read about it in any review) seems not entirely to have reached closure with his ex. Maybe is considering getting back with her? But suddenly the movie cuts; it\'s years later; the dad is with another woman and has had a baby with her. I don\'t know about you, but between those cuts there might have been some good drama, but it\'s just skipped. Despite the title, the film dwells on every family member, so it\'s not like Ethan Hawke is a minor character. Yet they pass over a giant life event.\r Minor spoiler is now over.\r Yes stories should flow from character, but there should still be a story. Character reveals itself through the crucible of a crisis. Aside from the drama early on with the mom\'s domestic issue, there is no crisis here, and no story. When Hitchcock was asked what he thought of slice-of-life stories, he said he preferred to give people a slice of cake. I left this movie hungry for that cake. And besides, so-called slice-of-life stories, the good ones, do have a crisis. It\'s just that it\'s subtle. We didn\'t get that here.\r There is no depth of the boy\'s life plumbed here. Just sketchy skit-like scenes semi-related.\r Another point. Aside from Ethan Hawke, no one in this movie seems to have a positive attitude about anything ever. It\'s one thing not to be Disney, but this movie mistakes chronic maudlin negativity for drama. A story requires conflict. But much of the activity in this film doesn\'t rise to the level of actual conflict. Instead it\'s just a manifestation of some kind of low grade depression that never quits and slowly grinds down the teeth on the gears of your spirit.\r Even though the movie is too realistic, in other ways it is too unrealistic. There is oddly stilted fake sounding dialog in the first 20 minutes or so. Also, the son (the ""boy"" of the title) encounters adult men who act exactly the same toward him all the time, step dad, teacher, boss, all of them criticize him in exactly the same way, and that\'s all they do. You could switch out the dialog for all these guys. They are all the same. Except Ethan Hawke. Another unrealistic thing. When the boy finally lands a girlfriend, she just happens to be one of the most beautiful women you\'ve ever seen in a movie. This pimply pug nosed boy, without athleticism, brilliance, money, or particular promise, gets a girlfriend who probably would have thought herself too good for a young George Clooney. It\'s ridiculous. And they were going for extreme realism?\r In my own life growing up I encountered some real weird sh!t. So did friends. They say \'sh!t happens\' for a reason. But if this is supposed to be this kid\'s life, either they skipped over that type of dramatic stuff or he had one heck of a mundane childhood! Also, these people seem to have no center. If they have values or principles or beliefs, that\'s skipped over too. There is some banter that might try to be passing for philosophy but it amounts to nothing of substance. Yes as an adult paying bills and just trying to survive, you don\'t go around espousing basic values every day of your life, but these people seem so empty inside, as if they are animals that just happen to be able to speak. There\'s something off-putting about them from my perspective. They are not like people I have ever known.\r Ethan Hawke does a good job acting in Boyhood, but why did he agree to do it? Predestination, his other new movie, is sci-fi, but it\'s also a study of character as revealed and developed through a protagonist\'s response to a crisis. It is stellar, brilliant, the best of the best. I am chalking it up on my list of the very best films (of any genre) that I have seen. It will be right beside Before Sunset on my BLU Ray shelf. Predestination raised Ethan Hawke in my estimation, and even Boyhood, which I saw a short time later, cannot bring him down entirely. So let me divert you dear reader. See Predestination.

Whether it’s in his Before Trilogy which captures the arc of a relationship over a decade or his lighter fare like Dazed and Confused which looks back on our teenage years through the lens of nostalgia, he has shown an uncanny ability to demonstrate on screen the subtleties of how time affects us all. Boyhood, which was shot over twelve years, following characters as the actors that play them literally age, is Linklater’s magnum opus. The persistence and determination of the all involved in the production is admirable and they deserve the attention they are receiving, however what is more remarkable is the film itself. A film so modest, light, and carefree and yet so powerful, Boyhood is the antithesis of the modern Hollywood blockbuster (Interstellar) characterized by their pomposity and heavy handedness.

There\'s literally nothing that happens. It\'s about a boy living an extremely dull and cliched life. There\'s virtually no drama that happens throughout the entire movie, and the drama that is presented is still quite listless and unimportant. In other words, this movie is about as plot-less as a movie can get. It took twelve years to film, and yet, those years span by quickly and dully, one event after the other, with no point or order, just chaotic and random. But what makes the movie so dull was the main character.\r In the movie, there is nothing bad happens to the main character, nothing to make you connect with him. There\'s nothing life changing. In fact, the three biggest ""bad"" things that happen to him are that his mother can\'t find ""the right guy"" (after divorcing his father, she marries her college professor who turns out to become a drunk, and then she marries one of her own college students, who turns out to have mental stability problems due to him serving in the military; both of which she ends up divorcing as well), and his father sells the car that he had thought would be his when he turned sixteen, and his girlfriend cheated on him, which resulted in their relationship ending. Other than this, nothing happens. He literally goes through life showing as little emotion as possible, just floating by, as though he was in a coma, or constantly tired.\r So, finally, after two hours and thirty mintutes, you come towards the end of the movie. The ""boy"" is now an adult who has graduated high school and who is going to be going to college. Upon him packing his last things, his mother breaks down saying that there\'s nothing more that is going to happen with her life. That her life has just been a series of events: her having her children, her divorcing her husband, her raising her children, her marrying a man, divorcing  him, raising her kids some more, marring her college student just to divorce him as well, and finally, her sending first her daughter to college, and then her son. Then she concludes with saying that what comes next is, ""[her] funeral."" To this, the boy, replies that she\'s off by forty years, ""or something."" Then she says that, ""[she] expected there to be more."" The movie then cuts to him driving on the road to college.\r When he finally arrives at college, he meets his new roommate, who is friendly and invites him to go hiking with his girlfriend and another friend (who is also a girl). When Mason (the main character) sees that she\'s pretty, he decides that he\'ll go. Before he goes, his new roommate hands him a hallucinatory mushroom and says that by the time they reach the mountains, it will have an effect. It then fast forwards to them walking to the mountains and we see that Mason and the new girl are getting along very well. Then it cuts to them sitting and chatting. Across the distance, he sees his roommate yelling into the wind, and he begins to talk to this new girl, named Nicole, about how we need to, ""seize the moment."" Nicole replies with saying, ""I think moments seize us,"" and it shows Mason thinking for a moment, and then it cuts to the end credits.\r I think what bothered me the most about the film was the fact that, despite it having no order, there was a point, but it wasn\'t that great of one. Mason, who lived his entire boring life on coasting mode is finally forced to see that if he keeps doing this, he will end up like his mom––just living, but not truly alive in the sense of being satisfied with life. The point is that we need to let the moments seize us, and we need to live. Yet, what made this theme so irrelevant was the fact that there was hardly a moment for him to have ever seized! There was no bad, barely any good, nothing that would have made is life have any significant meaning. By the end of the movie, you ask yourself, ""Is my life really this boring?"" And do you know what my answer was? ""No, there\'s more drama in mine.""\r In conclusion, if you want to see a long movie that drags on and on about a boy just living his life, then you\'ll love this movie. Even though it had a theme presented at the end, in my opinion, it just wasn\'t enough to save the movie overall. It is sad really, because it was such an ambitious project. But by creating such a dull life where nothing happens, I feel that they wasted those twelve years, because in all actuality, most people\'s lives are far more chaotic and show signs of actual character development due to things that happen, both good and bad, in their lives. That\'s what this movie failed to do: deliver on experiences that are worth watching. What\'s left instead is dull, listlessness that fails to satisfy someone who wanted to be entertained. I wanted to see sadness, hopelessness, as well as extreme elation and happiness. To see someone grow into a great person despite and because of circumstances.

Boyhood celebrates life like no other and examines its often obscure meaning.\r The film chronicles the fictional life of Mason from age five to eighteen. The plot follows his coming to age and the turmoil it often brings. This film is unique when it comes to story telling because it was filmed over the course of twelve years. This allows the film makers to experiment like no other and exemplifies to its audience the real time that passes in between scenes. You watch as Mason matures and you develop a deep connection with him that is almost universally unrivaled by other films. I became so engrossed in his character that the nearly three hour run time felt like mere minutes.\r Boyhood is brimming in high quality. Richard Linklater directed this film flawlessly. His direction highlights the emotion of  the film and projects life into it’s characters. Linklater’s screenplay also perplexes the characters and is filled with memorable dialog and subtle wisdom. The combination of these elements defines the film and its soul. The assembled cast is also top notch. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette star, and newcomer Ellar Coltrane plays the title role of Mason. The chemistry between the actors is unmatched and it only continues to evolve as the film progresses.\r Boyhood is a celebration of life, from its triumphs to it’s heartbreak. It inspires us to live and as the film so eloquently put it “let the moment size you”. Boyhood instills its soul into every frame. It teaches us that life worth living. It shows us that beauty is all around us and we simply just have to let go to experience it. Boyhood is unlike anything that has proceeded it and likely unlike anything that will follow.

The cinematography is extraordinary for the time, but that’s the case with most of Hitchcock’s works. The meticulous camerawork goes along with the structure of the film, with wide angles that follow Scottie’s eyes through the investigation, warmer closeups after he finds love, and again wide but this time disorienting cuts in the third part as the mystery unfolds and Scottie loses his mind. The theme of the “spiral“ associated with the feeling of vertigo is also recurrent both visually and narratively. Technicolor is used as an expressive means, with vivid and vibrant colors standing for Scottie’s passion and fantasies, and dark, pale palettes once he faces reality in the ending. Judy is often associated with different shades green, bright for her dress as Madeleine, dim when she connects with Carlotta at the cemetery and at the museum. During her iconic metamorphosis scene in the hotel room, the green neon lights paint the whole room in an eerie, unnatural tint that creates an uncanny atmosphere and points out Scottie’s twisted desire to connect to an otherworldly dimension. The camera uses broad POV angles when following the eye of the investigation, changes to warm close-ups when love begins, and then switches back to wide but disorienting frames as Scottie starts getting lost. These are all pretty common techniques in modern filmmaking, but that found one of their first mature expressions here. The special effects and painted sceneries surely show their limits, but are also used tastefully in the memorable nightmare sequence.Unfortunately, the script and acting are not up to par, at times leaning towards soap-opera level melodrama. The film is indeed a fascinating mystery that masterfully portrays a woman’s inner conflict and a psychopath’s pathetic obsession for something that is not real (his attempt at “resurrecting” Madeleine by humiliating Judy as a woman, his lifetime search for a love that is not ordinary despite having someone who truly cares always beside him). However, I couldn’t feel for the mawkish sentimentalism and soppy love story at all. While it’s clear that there is no deep connection between the two from a rational point of view, the film keeps forcing it on you idealizing their passion with corny dialogues and music. Everyone just remembers Herrmann’s hypnotic opening theme, but the rest is just your average Hollywood melodrama.These issues might be marginal for a film that, after all, reflects the taste of a sixty-year-old Hollywood, but prevented me from considering “Vertigo” as a timeless masterpiece.… Expand\n', '\nAn autentic shocker of suspense from the one and only master.

I remember my mom holding this movie in an unusual esteem and personal engagement that she so rarely held anything in. My mom was my mom though, and when she loved something, she really loved it, more than anyone has loved anything else, and this, to her, was one of those movies. I didn\'t fully get it as a kid. Where movies were supposed to make you feel emboldened and secure in your values, this strange new kind of movie flew in the face of that, and seemed to like making you feel cold, naked, and dumb.It\'s been years since then, and I\'ve seen this movie quite a few times. It\'s the perfect, endlessly-rewatchable thriller. Knowing the conclusion to the whole affair actually improves, holding the audience captive in perfect suspense, with each insidious narrative turn tightening the noose around the audience\'s neck. And when the conclusion does arrive, the first-time unassuming audience is shocked, but not offended. All along there were clues, inaccuracies that could only possibly amount to one conclusion. It\'s not so much that the audience forgets these clues as much as they choose to forget these clues, preferring one ""truth"" over another.It\'s this predicament that our protagonist, Scottie Ferguson, finds himself. However, his actions run perpendicular to the audiences wishes, turning up every stone, prying at every loose end until inevitably he undoes whatever happy ending he wrote for himself. It\'s his feverish search for ""the truth"" that makes him such a tragedy, and, to his friend and living-partner Midge, a comparatively well-adjusted, capable woman, such a mystery. He\'s the kind of paranoid, troubled individual who gets by on the notion that people are never really paying attention to the right things. His ""truth"" here is the mystery of one Madeleine Elster, a wife of an old friend who he (meaning the friend) believes to be possessed/hypnotized/some odd thing. Less important to Scottie are the specifics, choosing instead to understand a ""bigger picture"" that chronically eludes him.Hitchcock\'s direction perfectly compliments the sadness and claustrophobia of the film, which is shot in film\'s favorite city, San Francisco, which just so happens to be my home city. The film prefers quiet over loud, dimly lit, gothic cathedrals with narrow, dark corridors, paired with voyeuristic figures looking on like a moth attracted to lit. It prefers empty city streets and lifeless, seemingly abandoned docks. It\'s the city as intimate and naked as it comes. Not so much Norman Rockwell as it is Edward Hopper, the film is photogenic as all-get-out, but unbearably lonely. The lighting enhances the mood, using shadows at the edge of the screen to draw its figures together, obscuring desired women-as-objects under sickly green curtains. Vertigo take its audience\'s plaintive hopes for some virtue or nugget of personal triumph, and, rather than lazily turn it against them, draws upon our collective sadness for inspiration. In the end, Scottie is an everyman, living only to view goodness and light through some distant lens, and is simply the victim of being too observant, too clever, and too skeptically honest to ever really leave well enough alone. He\'s an emblem of the eternal shifting mass of the chronic, who remain miserable in their search for fulfillment, yet blinded by its need for closure. When the ideal presents itself, reality follows, ever-mocking, ever-naked in its approach.… Expand\n', '\nOne of Hitchcocks greatest masterpieces.

At the back your thoughts, you are always waiting to get things serious. Gritty. Bloody. Brutal. Intense. And it is these films that makes us expect these things from a genre as such. Not even touching the Rocky milestone, I am just playing around Raging Bull by Martin Scorsese and Battling Butler by Michel Keaton- someone from Charlie\'s days itself.

His method of living up to that ""dutiful"" objective is somewhat different. Nay, not different. Mature. Ahead of time. He doesn\'t pay homage to those heavy lifters by putting them in the ring, but does it so elegantly in the dressing room. From hard work to the stakes that are played every night on the screen, everything is mocked or more accurately notified in Charlie\'s dictionary. There is a sense of pride in carrying that note.And maybe that is why he has crafted such an empathetic and a low key character in the rest of the screen time. He is wreck but an adoptable one. Another thing that makes this film incredibly different than the others is the jokes. All the jokes are an elaborative comic sketches that takes energy along with time for it to work, from you.

Modern Times and the Great Dictator, rank higher for me personally. Though to the man himself, this is his favourite film and Welles, Kubrick, Tarkovsky and Woody Allen agree. It is strange though that Chaplin's 3 greatest works came after he was deemed obsolete, but being the artistic Luddite, he was. He pushed forward and did not allow modern technology to steal his craftsmanship. In a way, you must applaud that, but at the same time from a critical analysis standpoint, you must also detract marks for it. For is it genius? Or a has-been doing their best to cling on to a world that has moved beyond them?BE: With a Chaplin film you have to ask yourself can you really comment on the directing. Given that he does a large percentage of the workload himself, it would be like applauding Michelangelo's overseeing of the Sistine Chapel rather than the painting itself. The editing is decent, and the transitions move swiftly and give a sense of speed and the story with what limited cinematography we have for the time.W: The writing is simple but effective. Some claim that the pathos as they put it is limiting the film and not allowing it to be as good as it can be. However, we have seen the Tramp 12 times prior to this, and this is the last outing. Giving this comedic character a sense of compassion and sympathy at this stage is where the story should progress. Rather than leaving it in the purely farcical realm. We have completeness and sadness that often appears in great comedy, and from the very first scene with the Tramp and the blind girl, we have a pleasant mix of longing with pratfall comedy.C: It is 1931, and Fritz Arno Wagner is continuing to put Hollywood cinematography to shame. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Chaplin has brought along his old standby in Roland Totheroh, and he provides the standard for a Chaplin outing. The angles on some shots are nice, and some of the shadow work is pleasant, but nothing outstanding.A: At the beginning of the film, it says it is in pantomime, which implies over the top acting and with subtly and nuance removed from the piece. Which would be fine, save for the fact that it does have these things due to the previously mentioned pathos. Which forces me to be meaner on some of the more weak acting exhibited by the rest of the crew. Chaplin is excellent and very few people have such command of body language as he. The blind girl did not always feel blind, but we are still in the early days of cinema, so it is slightly excusable.\xa0S: The opening of the film is annoying in terms of sound. We have mumbled audio from several characters, and then the Tramp appears and then silence. Which seems to imply yes films have dialogue now but let us enjoy this nostalgic throwback. Which is an excellent way of presenting the film, but in terms of audio quality, it is weak, and we could have had that same effect while presenting clear audio to the viewer. The rest is standard silent film fare.PD: The sets are sets of the era, and they took effort, but nothing stands out, especially when one knows what is coming in the 1930s in regards to set design.BA: Costume design is again very Hollywood and of the era. Nothing makes it feel all that special save for the Tramp himself.EVO: Thoroughly enjoying and while the comedy is not on par with the circus or modern times. It offers the viewer so much more and allows us to see how romantic films should be done. I kid you not. Look at most of the great romantic movies, and you will find that the romance in the film is left in the background and only adds to the overall work. Like a lovely sauce over a delicious meal.

Many of the character relationships make little to no sense based on what is occurring in the movie.  This is a dark coming of age tale, but loses much of it's believability early on in the movie.  To start, the bullies of the movie recognize the main character as gay long before he himself does, almost making it seem as though because they call him gay he then turns gay. It is hard to care overmuch about the main character as he has maybe 25 lines in the entire movie, and anytime he does talk it's 4-5 word sentences followed by long stretches of silence. I guess this was supposed to be an interesting character trait, but when the movie contains nothing but dialog and the main character doesn't talk it seems like a bit of a problem. It's exacerbated by the fact that every other character in the movie constantly points it out. The best friend/lover is equally confusing throughout the movie.  His sexuality is seemingly fluid ranging from dude bro misogyny to handjibbers at the beach.  At least the friend/lover was charismatic and for me the only redeeming actor in the movie.  Every other character could have been played by anyone, the mom especially lacked presence in the film with the exception of the scene in which she forcibly takes money from her son.  Not a bad movie, but it left much to be desired.  The music and cinematography were strong, but total lack of likeable characters, and odd character choices felt like it detracted from the any real entertainment value that could have been found here. The biggest problem was the main characters arc, troubled gay kid in broken home beats the **** out of bully, disappears, comes back as a drug peddler.  In the interim has not touched another person man or women, comes back and I guess gets back with his childhood hand jibber giver for love ever after?

It is not a ‘Gay’ and/or ‘Black’movie meant only for a minority as it gets into the many feelings all human beings go through.Chiron (Alex Hibbart as the 9 year old, Ashton Sanders, the teenager and Trevante Rhodes as the adult) goes from being an alienated, bullied boy to a muscled drug dealer who nobody fools with and in a way has followed the path of his mentor and surrogate father, Juan (Mahershala Ali), who taught the kid how to swim and discover himself.We also meet his friend Kevin (played at the three same stages as Chiron by Jadin Piner, Jharrel Jerome and Andre Holland), his mother (Naomie Harris) and Juan’s girlfriend (Janelle Monae) who offers Chiron a place to stay whenever he needs one.Chiron, as many gay kids, of any color, becomes a loner, is beaten up by schoolmates and accepts whatever kindness he receives. It was interesting following his path and where it goes. The scene in the diner is a love story unto itself though nothing is said about love except for a record playing on the jukebox.The film failed me in that certain sections the jargon, vernacular, made it difficult for me to hear what was being said though I understood what was being done just as I didn’t quite understand the relationship between Juan and Chiron and how it became about and took the turn it did. Also a few very interesting characters just disappear from the film. I wasn’t aware the N word was used so much between Blacks as it is here at a certain level.All 3 actors playing Chiron are outstanding as is the oldest Kevin. The arch of Chiron’s life holds your interest though at times moves too slowly. Ali’s Juan is an imposing figure and the two women, Harris and Monae, especially the former are strong in their portrayals. The direction and screenplay by Barry Jenkins, based on his life, tackles a rarely told story in the movies but it is also about loneliness and trying to answer the question “Who am I?”  Some scenes are held too long, others don’t finish the thoughts being expressed. There are two powerful scenes I don’t think I will forget though they may go over the heads of others.I do recommend “Moonlight” but don’t go in with high expectations as I did and approach it as going to see a good film with a new story.… Expand\n', '\nGood, but slightly over-rated by media hype.

He never has any character growth and the reward in the end thusly doesn\'t feel earned. Jiminy while funny and a great character overall, doesn\'t do anything to further the plot. He\'s more along for the ride than anything, despite him having been tasked with being Pinocchio\'s ""Conscience"". His reward in the end is also, not well earned.

Based on the 19th century book by Carlo Collodi, but not half as unpleasant, Pinocchio combines winning animation with great humor and excitement. There are songs, but they\'re never like the huge production numbers that last four minutes and feature the voice of some up-and-coming princess of pop (who\'ll be gone in a year) that the studio later adopted with the applicable exception of When you Wish Upon a Star. My favorite song is ""Little Wooden Head"" which is featured in the beginning and is a truly wonderful scene as Gepetto and Figaro play happily with the new puppet.The movie takes a sadistic, cruel, heartless little wooden boy (Collodi\'s character) and turns him into an interesting, 3-dimensional kid with a good heart but who is weak-willed and doesn\'t always listen to reason. The animation makes brilliant use of the multiplane camera, featuring a sprawling opening sequence in which the viewer practically sees the entire village at night. The characters are colorful and fun (I especially love Honest John Foulfellow and his sidekick Gideon) and the story has never a dull moment. This film is a reminder of the sort of efforts Disney put int o their films; the man himself had a great storytelling passion that was lost in later works (Alice in Wonderland, 101 Dalmatians). Pinocchio was never as famous as some of the others, and this is unfortunate because it is his masterpiece.… Expand\n', '\nThe best, GREATEST thrilling and inspiring animated musical movie ever made!

His story begins in the Italian workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio will be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. However, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who convinces him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead, he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who promises to pay them money if they can find naughty little boys for him to take to Pleasure Island. Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in smoking, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island transform into donkeys for their misbehavior and are sold to slave labor in the salt mine and circus. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape the island, only with donkey ears and a tail.Upon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find the workshop vacant. They soon get a letter from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had ventured out to sea to save Pinocchio from Pleasure Island, but was swallowed by a giant whale named Monstro, and is now living in his belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. Geppetto, Figaro, Cleo, and Jiminy are washed up safely on a beach, but Pinocchio is shown apparently lifeless in a rockpool.Back home, an inconsolable Geppetto weeps over Pinocchio as Jiminy Cricket and the pets also mourn the loss. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and selfless. To reward him, the Blue Fairy resurrects Pinocchio, reversing the Pleasure Island curse and turning him into a real boy. Pinocchio awakens and reveals that he is alive and a real human boy, much to everyone's joy. As everyone celebrates, Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.… Expand\n"", '\nPinocchio ’s story tells us:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Life is a big adventure after another.

The inner politics depicted among the greedy friends and the good old ""morality"" conflicts that it raises, is the ingenious yet simply sensible take of the makers especially when the heat is communicated directly to the audience, it gets better as it ages on screen. It is rich on technical aspects like sound effects, background score, editing and art design. The primary reason the feature offers a satisfactory outcome is that not only is it unpredictable but is justifying with genuine reasoning which is the soul in here. The structure of the script may be familiar but its additional and side characters does make it worth keeping the audience engaged offering them enough work and art to explore in it. John Houston; the screenwriter-director, uses its smart adaptation wisely and brilliant execution skills on creating the anticipated vision on screen.

Guillermo del Toro combines great storytelling and elements of fantasy to create a surging plot which succeeds in capturing our imagination, mood and emotions.\r We follow two story lines. The one rooted in reality is about a secluded small town ruled by a despotic captain tasked with wiping out the remnants of the resistance which has taken shelter in the surrounding jungles. The other one is about a young girl, Ofelia, who is forced to accept the captain as her stepfather. She is fond of fairy tales which she carries everywhere. Whether the faun promising her passage to the virtually perfect world is an escapist fantasy of hers or not is left up to the viewer to decide.\r Del Toro relies chiefly on score, voice-over and narration to create momentum. The editing was successful in keeping the audience eyeing every dialogue. The fact that the majority must have been following subtitles for the entire length of the movie did not lessen the effect the film has on you, but on the contrary created a world that was mesmerizing.\r The movie is set in Francoist Spain. The art direction painted a vivid picture of the 1940s through depicting the buildings, cars and costumes of that era. We also get to witness some of the lifestyle of the time. The faun creature, who gives Ofelia tasks to complete in order to gain entrance into the Underground Realm was a particularly unique creation. The work done deserved the Oscar it received.\r Frequently the story transitions into the fantasy part. We learn about the lost princess, who Ofelia thinks is herself. The pregnancy of Ofelia's mother is a major concern throughout the movie. It is feared that there's an informer for the rebels inside the camp, of whose identity Ofelia comes to learn of.\r The captain is a megalomaniac who insults people with his every breath and is bent on destroying the insurgency. Despite proof of his madness, Del Toro resists the temptation of painting him as an irredeemable person. He shows leniency now and then, and on one occasion hints that loyalty to him would have worked out better for a certain character. He is a man built for conflict, and actively seeks it. He always carries a watch on him which ticks loudly to keep him on schedule, even in the middle of gunfights. He is also fond of torturing captured people.\r The action sequences were well drawn and made what was happening clear. Light is used to control mood. The score is poignant and memorable and haunting. The visual effects creates the creatures of this fantasy world which rivals any done by the mainstream Hollywood. A lot of this creativity went into showing how people were killed.\r The pace picks up during the second half. The resistance becomes bolder and gets reinforcements. There were a few scenes of cathartic killing and blood-letting. And we also learn the final fate of the main characters.\r Despite the fact that the fantasy element has a marginal effect on the progress of the story, the movie becomes something special with its inclusion. The contrast between a child's wish to be somewhere safe where she would be loved and the skirmishes between the government troops and the rebels finally makes the message very clear in the end.… Expand\n"", ""\nThis is why User Reviews can't be take seriously! 106 as of today people gave this movie a negative review?

As such, the film almost plays out the two 'sides of the story' seamlessly, so beautifully moulded together that the line between fantasy and reality is blurred. We see the world for what it is and the world for what the young girl makes it out to be, her coping strategy, to put it bluntly.

""Pan\'s Labyrinth"" is one of the cinema\'s great fantasies--rich with darkness and wonder. It\'s a fairy tale of such potency and grandeur, that it reconnects the adult imagination to our primal thrill, and horror stories that held us spellbound as children. As gruesome and brutal as it is enchanting and spellbinding--""Pan\'s Labyrinth"" is a movie intended for adults. It is a harsh, uncompromising film--but equally just as beautiful and moving.""Pan\'s Labyrinth"" is itself a narrative maze, with multiple stories that branch apart and back together again. This dark fairy tale plays out against the backdrop of Spain in 1944. A monstrous Fascist captain (López) is determined to flush out soldiers of the resistance, as his pregnant wife arrives at his countryside headquarters with her young daughter. The young girl Ofelia (Baquero), escapes the brutality of her new environment by drifting into a fantasy world where she comes across a mysterious faun. The faun tells her that she is a princess from a kingdom in the underground. The faun also tells that her that her father is waiting for her, but she needs to accomplish three challenging and dangerous assignments first. Ofelia\'s challenges do not arise like arbitrary plot obstacles--they are organic to her (and the movie\'s) development. She learns not only to follow instructions--and that there are heavy prices to pay for failing to abide by them. But also to trust her own instincts about what is right and wrong. In order to find her true self, she must also find the her inner-strength to break the rules imposed by authority. An individual conscience. What could be a more powerful anti-fascist weapon than that?\rIn a dark, harsh, and violent world, Ofelia lives in her magical world trying to survive her tasks and see her father again. Soon, the line between fantasy and reality begins to blur, and before Ofelia can turn back, she finds herself at the center of the ferocious battle between Good and Evil. Incredibly unique fable that blends fantasy and fearsome violence, ultimately merging the two stories together.

As much as simply enthralling its first half is, that follows a linear singular path collecting its plot points like a reward the film moves with ferocious pace and nail biting close calls. But the second half is the one with the real meat. Its complex and at times overstuffed characters with their own agendas and schemes does work since the man behind the camera is Hitchcock. He never lets the content go damp which often happens in such husky script. There is a sense of similarity in here to Polanski's Chinatown, starring Nicholson. And similar to it, the uncertainty is the key to its success.The makers are consistently revealing cards in order to keep the audience tangled in the whirls of these flips and turns that can be difficult to swallow. It is a mature script that always chooses over leaving the room with a cutthroat message rather than an explosion. The euphoric energy of the ping pong that the writers play of who is with whom theories, with Hitchcock's sharp execution it never wears off. Also, there is real ruggedness in here, the characters have the range to look elegant and also pull out the most sinister deed of all.Grant as the real victim proving his innocence isn't always in his A game, his performance isn't persistent in its tone. But what saves the day is both Saint's performance and her character, her alluring suave nature and guns blazing unflinchingly puts her on top of the list.

The script revolves around a confusion of identities, where an ordinary citizen is mistaken for a spy and ends up in a tremendous confusion with gigantic repercussions on his personal life and national security.The script is quite good and the story has no dead moments. It entertains the audience in a perfect way until the end and makes us curious to know what is really going on, curiosity being an important part of what keeps us stuck in the film (and one of the reasons I prefer to hardly talk about the plot). The main character, played by Cary Grant, was so well thought out that we quickly established an affective and sympathetic link with her, caring about what will happen to her. It goes without saying that, although the cast is very good, it is really Cary Grant who stands out here. Eva Marie Saint is good, but she never leaves the shadow of the male protagonist. Another actor that deserves a positive note is Martin Landau.Technically, it is an impeccable film, to the taste of director Hitchcock. It is full of symbolic scenes or with more than one meaning, some of them bordering on the dreamlike. Some of the scenes are truly striking, like those that were shot on Mount Rushmore.

Filmed over the course of the high school career of two black teenagers from poor neighborhoods in Chicago, Hoop Dreams paints a starkly realistic picture of the high stakes of basketball and the influence the sport can have on a young black man\'s life. The film evolves into almost a tale of two cities, with the boys developing considerably differently as they go through high school, and the challenges they face at each. Without divulging too much of the plot, both boys are invited to attend a private, suburban, mostly white high school with a legendary team history, but only one can remain. Once the paths of the boys split, the divisions in class become evident as the other boy attends a mostly black inner-city high school. One is afforded opportunities and saving graces, while the other must scrape by. Another reason for the film\'s power is the depiction of the home life of the boys, showing the hurdles that they must overcome on the homefront. ""The system"" is mentioned frequently by one of the boy\'s mothers, and the effects of the system can be seen clearly both on and off the basketball court. Basketball is a pivotal method of understanding race and class in America, and Hoop Dreams explores all these themes and more with effortless grace. Your heart will race during the games, whether you like basketball already, or haven\'t thought once about the hardwood.

Kurosawa adds his own ending and moral conclusion to break free from the complete distrust in humanity suggested by Akutagawa\'s original tale: despite the lies of history and the fallacies of human nature, we have to keep on living, be charitable, and do the best we can.

They\'re not antiheros.  You need to have some redeeming characteristics to qualify as an antihero.  And if you\'re going to carry a movie you need some redeeming characteristics. Don Corleone had his family ""honor.""  Tommy DeVito made for a funny psycho.  William Holden and company are all fine actors, but their characters are dry as dust and we the audience are supposed to sympathize because they\'re ageing out of the outlaw business and the times they are a-changing.

We\'re supposed to go along with this.  And, sorry, but I ain\'t buying.Sure, the bad guys do a couple of things that might be described as ""nice,"" but there\'s nothing in the film to explain why these particular characters would do things like this, since gold and profit seem to be their only motivation.I wondered if my criticism of the film might be unfair because, after all, it was shot in 1969.

These narrative attributes are thanks in no small part to master storyteller and novelist Graham Greene, who penned the film\'s screenplay. This is a project that takes great pride in its slow burn approach, offering up a veneer of normalcy to the viewer, but with little nuances in the dialogue, tonality and camerawork to let you know something\'s not quite right here. Once the reveals come, though, I\'ll say I had a consistently pervasive smile on my face. Any and every scene with Orson Welles is nothing short of iconic.

And even though this uncertain shady streets follows a typical cat and mouse chase, unfortunately there seems to be very little skin in the game on terms of narration. And despite of the fact that the storyline suggests the inseparable chemistry between the lead characters, there is very little romance among the antics. Plummeting downwards by an immense pressure of almost overstuffed material, Reed seems to be in some sort of hurry to catch up the next act. In order to do so, it achieves a ferocious pace but doesn't quite glorifies the thrills and stakes of the circumstances.The makers could have easily milked out more cinema by savoring the concept and slowing down the procedure for a better effect. Nevertheless these minor complications can easily be leapt over by a gripping thriller that it maps out on screen. Welles as the ultimate flip of the act, has unfortunately a one dimension side of his to portray, and yet with spooky expressive performance, he sticks the landing. Cotten as the leader that we all follow, the victim, the protagonist, has fairly much wider room to factor in along with Valli's love angle.No matter how thought provoking and absorbing Reed's world is, it certainly is too mechanical to bubble up as a free spirit. There are too many strings tied for it to be independent of the traffic which at times holds it back; the semantics is the double edged sword, both productive and consuming.

Set during the American civil war and told from the perspective of white Southerners, the film has long been felt to be one of America’s finest. It took 10 gongs at the 1940 Oscars, including one for Hattie McDaniel, who was the first black person to win an Academy award.Sign up for Guardian Today US edition: the day's must-reads sent directly to you Read moreThe book, as well as the film, says Lumenick, “buys heavily into the idea that the civil war was a noble lost cause and casts Yankees and Yankee sympathisers as the villains”. It also, he writes, goes to “great lengths to enshrine the myth that the civil war wasn’t fought over slavery — an institution the film unabashedly romanticises”.Lumenick speculates that many in the Academy likely feel the same way, noting that The Wizard of Oz – which was defeated as best picture by Gone with the Wind in 1940 – received a special 75th anniversary tribute. But during the same ceremony (in which 12 Years a Slave was ultimately named best picture) Gone with the Wind was all but ignored.The critic concludes: “What does it say about us as a nation if we continue to embrace a movie that, in the final analysis, stands for many of the same things as the Confederate flag that flutters so dramatically over the dead and wounded soldiers at the Atlanta train station just before the intermission?”… Expand\n"", '\nThe Best Chemistry between Actors of all time. extremely and actually amazingly well-constructed and conceived, without ever losing track of the core story – indeed, there’s almost no hope that any modern film , it’s almost pitiful – couldThe Best Chemistry between Actors of all time. extremely and actually amazingly well-constructed and conceived, without ever losing track of the core story – indeed, there’s almost no hope that any modern film , it’s almost pitiful – could ever hope to match the grandeur and brilliance of it, let alone reach it without seeming pretentiously overblown and just bad.

No matter where you stand politically and ethically, there is no denying the continued cultural and artistic merit this film maintains. The writing, the directing, the cinematography, special effects, editing, acting, character development, and score all maintain a sense of timelessness even today--nearly 80 years after this film first premiered. The film itself is very empathetic to the Confederacy and Slave culture as a whole. By all means, the film seeks to glorify and romanticize one of the darkest chapters in American history. Yet, the more socially progressive our society becomes the more important the film remains to be seen. Not as a celebration of our racism, but as a monument to never forget how messed up our culture was and continues to be. If anything, the film becomes almost a camp satire of itself--completely unaware of just how unethical and messed up it really is. This does not diminish its cultural relevance at all, but instead solidifies its importance.Slightly muted by the over-arching theme of slavery is the theme of a woman living in a society with a significant personality disorder that has gone diagnosed, and thus untreated. To many, including the society in which this story was written into as well as produced into a film, Scarlet\'s character can be immediately perceived as nothing more than, ""the typical woman; the stereotypical woman."" She is not supposed to immediately be easy to empathize with; she is, in fact, supposed to represent the audience member that immediately does not care about history--she is the self-centered, privileged white woman in the enslaved south with only frivolous pursuits of social dominance and courtship to occupy her immediate head space and concerns. This works on many levels to really expose her character, and in turn something about the human condition as a whole: Scarlet starts from the absolute top of societal privilege--she is young, beautiful, and so immensely wealthy that she literally has no concerns in the world other than the one she chooses to makeup in her own head. On top of this, you\'ve got Rhett--for all intensive purposes, the primary actual love interest of Scarlet throughout the movie. The two, in fact, do belong together because have how morally corrupted the both of them are. They, if anything, represent the two most morally corrupted people in all Confederate society. Willing to compromise loyalties for the sake of getting ahead. Then, of course, you have Ashley Wilkes and his wife that represent to Rhett and Scarlet the, ""idealistic, morally centered"" role models. However, nowadays this is the point where the satire comes in for screenings 80+ years later. EVERYONE is a slave owner, EVERYONE is fighting for the continued rate to use and profit from slave labor, so EVERYONE is already damned. If anything, Gone With the Wind is now a great representation of how an entire culture of people can be morally corrupted from the get go, but when you\'re surrounded by **** the debate comes down to which person\'s **** smells less bad. When it comes to that final line exchange of dialogue between Rhett and Scarlet at the end--at one time, the audience was supposed to side solely with Rhett who is now completely fed up both with himself, Scarlet, and the relationship as a whole. No one is truly, ""innocent"" in this mess--but, now with the added awareness of people with personality disorders, if anyone, Scarlet remains the most sympathetic character. Rhett is just a piece of **** unable to get over himself for anyone but the reflection of himself he saw in his daughter. But still--no one can actually be empathized with anymore because everyone owns slaves! It\'s a hilarious conundrum of already being damned by birthright.… Expand\n', ""\nLo que el Viento se Llevó (1939)Sinopsis:\n\nEste drama épico de la Guerra Civil se centra en la vida de la petulante belleza sureña Scarlett O'Hara.

Directed by Victor Fleming and produced by David O. Selznick, this film has a screenplay by Sidney Howard, based on a novel by Margaret Mitchell. The cast is headed by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.The story of this film is well known, so its difficult to spoil it. Scarlett is a rich, spoiled and capricious girl who likes parties and flirtations but loves Ashley Wilkes, engaged to her cousin Melanie, which awakens in her enormous jealousy. The hardness of the American Civil War destroys the world in which they live and forces the two cousins \u200b\u200bto help each other to survive, achieving that with the help of Rhett Butler, an industrial bachelor with very bad reputation that falls in love with Scarlett. Following are the efforts to rebuild everything that the winds of war destroyed.Vivien Leigh became, thanks to this, a film legend. Far from being a damsel in distress, her character solves the problems faced thanks to her tenacity and willpower. Its undoubtedly one of the strongest female characters of classical cinema, and makes a perfect match with the bluntness of truculent Captain Butler, played by Gable, one of the biggest heartthrobs that cinema known, famous for the many romances that he lived with most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. In fact, when this film was being shot, the most malicious voices wove several conjectures as to a probable passion between them, but the truth was more funny: the two actors didn't like each other and Leigh even criticized Gable because of his bad breath. And although Gable have hated this movie, the truth is that he has become immortal thanks to it. Olivia de Havilland, another great actress, shone in the role of sweet and kindhearted Melanie, and Leslie Howard did great success as Ashley. Try to analyze the technical aspects of this film is very impressive and shows us the artwork that it is. Hundreds of participants, thousands of horses, costumes designed to recreate the look of the historical clothing. The country scenes are fabulous and some of the war scenes are deeply moving, like the scenes where Scarlett help in the military hospital or the famous Scarlett's oath scene. One of the most famous sequences is the fire of the military barracks, where real fire was used, making the scene more realistic and truly anthological. Bright colors make the movie even more beautiful, from a visual point of view, and the soundtrack, of Max Steiner's authorship, is exceptional. The main theme is easily in the ear, having become one of the most famous songs of the cinema.For all these reasons, this movie immediately gained a huge popularity and is, today, one of the most profitable and popular films ever.

Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this film, considered by many his ""magnum opus"", has a screenplayThis film revolves around a small roadside motel run by Norman Bates, a seemingly nice man who lives under the undisputed authority of his mother. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this film, considered by many his ""magnum opus"", has a screenplay by Joseph Stefano and a cast led by Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles.I don\'t consider this film a horror movie, although its considered as such by most of people. It doesn\'t scare me, but let me uncomfortable, holding me to the screen. And I think that\'s what Hitchcock wanted to achieve. He was the master of suspense and knew how to hold the public, causing shivers of discomfort without putting the audience screaming in fear. The plot is brilliant, but the beginning doesn\'t show it, is intentionally unattractive in an effort to bring the public completely at ease... until Norman comes in. Norman Bates is one of the most psychologically complex characters I\'ve ever seen, and was developed to the extreme by the director and the artist who gave him life. It looks like a nice guy, who even flirts with the attractive woman he just met. The bathroom scene is perhaps one of the most famous in the film (I read somewhere that liquid chocolate was used to give the color that Hitchcock intended for the blood in the tub), and the incidental soundtrack used in that scene has become an icon for itself. But the end of the film is even better, with an absolutely staggering climax that makes all the audience feel that it was worth seeing the movie (even if you already know the whole story). The photograph, in black and white, makes a decisive contribution to increasing tension in the audience, and I am sure that this was a conscious and deliberate choice of Hitchcock to achieve that, showing again the great quality and talent of this director.Nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Art Direction in Film Black and White, Best Cinematography in Black and White, Best Direction and Best Supporting Actress, this film didn\'t win any of them, which shows us that, sometimes, the Academy also makes mistakes. But ""Psycho"" doesn\'t need an Oscar to be a tremendous success.

A woman, Marion Crane, that have a regular life with a hidden boyfriend. In one day, at her job, she steals a large amount of money and decides to run away into a new life. So she got out of the city and during her travel, ended up at the Bates Motel in a rainy night, when she got attended by Norman Bates, a young boy that apparentely lives with his mother and is very sympathethic. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock and written by Joseph Stefano.The storytelling and the atmosphere in here are everything. The whole set up of this film is really great, since the very begining you just got that some characters really like eachother justifying some actions that are way more ahead in the film, and that works, the dialogues works and the chemistry works for you to believe that Sam would go after Marion in that Motel. The whole sequence from Marion Stealing that money and reaching to the Motel is amazing, it is tense, you can feel the burden with her, she not knowing exactly what to do and being tense of each little thing that can happen. That creepy cop that shows up while she is sleeping is another very tense aspect, he keeps staring to her and making questions and neither you or her know if he knows that she have stolen the money or if he is trying to help or do something bad, after he starts to stalk her and watch her from far away things got even more creepy. The fact that when she arrives at the Bates Motel she is still worried about the money, trying to solve her problems and to accept somethings while we all know that there is something bigger wrong,\xa0is really well done. That whole sequence since when she arrives there we can see the atmosphere, the place, how detailed the dialogues are to make we understand the characters and to get into the situation. The giant plot twist, for nowdays i found it very predictable, like, we never get a clear shot of his mother's face, never seeing them moving together, but the fact is that for 1960, it was probably a big hit, at that time people probably got really surprised, so as they killing the apparent protagonist in the middle of the film, so there is some really different things for that time that are great. The turning point of the story from the Marion character, after her death, to focus more in Norman, the turning feels really nice and not forced.The acting is one giant good point for this film. Anthony Perkins is crazy in here, he does have so many layers that consists in his character that it is really great, he is first very cozy and welcoming, you not sure if he is just trying to be ok with the guests or if he wants some company because he is lonely. During on his conversations we can notice that somethings get him pumped, some principle of rage and insecurity, but small and going each by each you can totally tell that the guy is mad. During the very end with that monologue, the way that he reacts to what is being said and the way that he looks to the camera at the end is for sure one of the creepiest scenes in cinema history, that look and that smile starring right at you, that is really remarkable. Janet Leigh also did a really nice job, before the motel parts, you can totally see that she is distressed and not sure on what to do, her minimal details during dialogues with Norman really did evolve some moments. Vera Miles and John Gavin did a very nice duo, i bought that they really cared about Marion enough to do what they did. Martin Balsam is also really nice, he works like a fine noir detective with intriguing dialogues, going for the details in what people say.The cinematography in this movie is great. First the great decision to put this film in black and white, it totally makes sense on creating the atmosphere for this film, investigation and thriller moments work perfectly with this, the way you see the castle from down seeing it with the rain and lights on with shadows, that all was so well done. There camera positions and moviments that are realy very nice and it all helps to make the film more immersive. The soundtrack is amazing, the composition by Bernard Herrmann is really intriguin and scary as hell, it is the perfect kind of slasher music, wich, i'm sure, inspired some other great tracks in future.The film does have a nice dialogue from a psychiatrist about double personalities, how that work and what is happening in the mind of the person, that whole monologue was really intriguing and some good learns came from there.This is a very paranoic film, with a very nice narrative that will really out you in some thriller moments, very nice noir investigative and atmosphere situations, and a very memorable character.… Expand\n"", '\nClassic does not always mean great.

Hitchcock’s Studio, Paramount Pictures, wasn’t sure enough and disliked the film so they denied him a proper budget and the it was $800,000. The movie was in black and white. They even built a Bates Motel mansion at Universal. Psycho was Hitchcock’s best work while he had done some thrillers and horrors like Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963).  All of those were one of Hitchcock’s greatest works. Hitchcock also made rules for audiences for watching this film. “You must see PSYCHO from the very beginning. Therefore, do not expect to be admitted into the theatre after the start of each performance of the picture. We say no one -- and we mean no one -- not even the manager\'s brother, the President of the United States, or the Queen of England (God bless her)!""    -Alfred Hitchcock- They were really strict and lucky for me, I’m not a person from the 60s so I can watch whenever I want.  The performances were excellent and I mostly like Anthony Perkin’s role of Norman Bates. Perkins was good-looking and that’s exactly how Hitchcock wanted it to be just like that so Bates would look like a very likeable person with a charming character and made audiences believe him. They would think about him. Bates even disguised before he kill so that the victims would think it wasn’t Bates maybe? He could have not dress because the victims would be dead and they wouldn’t know. The way the iconic scene: the shower scene was pretty scary with its noise and when Marion Crane opened her eyes dying made the scene more terrifying and the way she was buried in the swamp was mostly frightening. She was naked and her things were in there. I knew it would be a good idea to bury your victim like that. What a genius! The story was told in a unique way. Even though the movie didn’t have much violence, but the mystery were also dreadful and made us worry about what really had happened. It’s also a great idea to shoot this movie not in technicolor but still remained black and white. That way would make Psycho a horror masterpiece no one could make like that. Psycho was really influential, the greatest work of Alfred Hitchcock and also the greatest horror movie and it still deserved that title until today, it’s still terrifying and scared a lot of audiences. It’s also a combination of horror, terror, violence, mystery and thriller. I would recommend this a must-see for horror fans.… Expand\n', '\nAbsolutamente marcante!O suspense construído aqui é uma obra de arte. Temos os atores que desempenham um papel fantástico aqui.

The singularity thatLucas doesn't disappoint, for a guy who is famous for his location shots, he is just driving in one car, a good old car.American GraffitiGeorge Lucas is a formidable filmmaker. Especially the randomness of his vision. The singularity that cannot be unmasked in the traffic of the ideas bombarded by him over his career. And as one does, as any filmmaker would do, he dives in on genre with utmost honesty and no bars holding him back. This film that reminds me of Richard Linklater's Dazed And Confused and Everybody Wants Some is a testimonial to what I think was the start off for the coming-of-genre. At least, in a more successful way. And even though it might not have set a trend for the other filmmakers, the unique elements driving this one long adventurous night is not the elements but their elaborative narrative structure.For instance if looked at the type of the film he has made, the sketch scenes are the bane of its existence. Good or bad, that is what we will get, have and deserve for consenting on driving along with these eccentric fellows. But as mentioned it is not enacted elaborative nature of the sketch but the meticulous branches it embraces. Those deep character peaks that broadens you mind and widens the theme giving the opportunity to let the makers gloat and enjoy what they have earned.And it has to be earned. Celebration doesn't come through its dutiful or necessary obligations but a well earned prophecy that it had already proclaimed in all its conscious behavior. Now drunk and completely full, the film has to just fire the repercussions that these characters had been inadvertently causing both to them and the environment they find palpable. The result is George Lucas's American Graffiti smartly and ambitiously pulling off a long sitcom special show or a finale, with a warm, sensible and a happy ending, just as the Saturday family matinee shows used to, in those days.… Expand\n"", ""\nDon't hate me but I really dont see what the big deal is.

I assume that this movie has established a new narrative style, and has proved that nostalgic films are not necessarily made for the sake of nostalgia, for it captures the zeitgeist of the 1960s America instead of mimicking it. A notable example of the influence of American Graffiti is Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused. And while I wasn't as engaged and invested in the characters of the former as I was with of the latter, American Graffiti admittedly is the more mature and thought-provoking of the two. The characters here have some depth you would probably never see in slice-of-life movies. And this comes from the sharp dialogue that fleshed out the characters throughout the movie's running time in a very subtle way.Some characters have better and more well-developed arcs than the others. They all are relatable, somewhat likable, and played by very good actors who did their best in their roles; but some character arcs feel as if they aren't fully-developed and lack some pieces in the middle. Ron Howard's character, Steve is a case in point; although I was quite invested in his character by the end of the movie.This leads us to my second issue with this movie, which I mentioned above. It's that the movie took me a little while to get into its characters and whole the story in general. I think the reason of this problem is that the movie promised me from its very beginning that it would focus on the characters' story-lines to flesh them out; not their journeys. Don't get me wrong, I adore slice-of-life and road movies, and I also knew that American Graffiti is this kind of a movie. But I guess the first minutes would a bit misleading, and therefore it took me sometime for the movie to draw me in.I can't praise the movie's soundtrack enough! I mean, it's absolutely one of the greatest film soundtracks ever! The movie wouldn't have been so nostalgic, if it wasn't for its killer soundtrack. It is a key factor in capturing the era's spirit, and also in giving the movie its distinctive bitter-sweet vibe. I think I won't stop listening to it for a long time!American Graffiti is also a proof that George Lucas is a great director as he is a great writer. I know that the dialogue is one of the film's best merits; but man, the camera work is so exquisite, and the color-grading is superb and quite expressive. The movie also has some brilliant moments of scene-blocking that, once again, gave the movie its evocative atmosphere.(8/10)… Expand\n""]"

I give the film a 6 rating as I continue to wonder what the excitement regarding it is all about..Perhaps the highest award should go to the distributor’s PR firm for being able to generate such unwarranted hype and activity..… Expand\n', '\n\n            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nNothing short of groundbreaking! Quality cinema. And no wonder it’s taken every award for Best Cinematography - so many beautiful shots, from the smashed mug on the floor to waves on the beach, to Cleo literally brushing up dog ****Great acting, a good pacing, that can sometimes feel like a slow-burn but it all just comes together!Now, my removal of 3 points may bare unpopular opinion, but I honestly felt like not a lot happened. It was a great film, with a pensive portrayal of the life of a beloved maid in 70s Mexico. Definitely one of the best films I’ve seen in ages, but I couldn’t tell what the climax was - the baby arriving or the kids drowning. While not every film needs a “climax” to sum up a great story, I just felt this was a slightly less enjoyable watch than A Star Is Born or even The Favorite. Roma is a film with a meticulously curated series of shots that cleverly cover a thin story. A film which the critics love but the audience may struggle to enjoy. I enjoyed it... It can take every Best Cinematography award, it’s unmatched this year, but Best Picture? Not too sure.… Expand\n', '\nOK, I\'ll say it -- when it comes to this film, the emperor is indeed naked.

I\'ll admit that the film\'s stunning black-and-white cinematography is exquisite and that the scenes introducing the picture\'s final act are emotionally mesmerizing (or maybe it\'s just that I was glad that something interesting was finally happening on the screen). Unfortunately, those are about the only redeeming qualities this release has to offer. The rest is a big, bloated, underdeveloped bore that tries the patience of even the most tolerant cinephile. It\'s obvious this was a heartfelt project for director Alfonso Cuaron, and his personal passion is written all over it. But, given that he\'s dealing with uninteresting characters in largely unexplained circumstances in a time frame for which little to no context or back story is provided, he\'s not giving the audience much to work with other than a glib implication that essentially says ""This is authentic -- just trust me on this."" Also, the picture\'s anemic attempts at incorporating philosophical and metaphysical themes show the filmmaker\'s got some brushing up to do in terms of effectively conveying his meaning in a comprehensible way.

It is obviously copying Zerkalo (The Mirror) by Tarkovsky but with far less ingenuity, creativity and poetry. Whereas Tarkovsky makes his life and his memories interesting by cleverly destroying time and space, blurring the lines between reality and dream, and making us think, think, think about our own memories, Cuaron serves a linear, egotistical, boring diaporama of his own life that didn\'t touch me at all. All this of course with a heavy dose of sentimentality and ""humanism"" that can\'t go wrong with middle-class critics.But what about the cinematography?The initial slow constant circular movement of the camera is obviously designed to clash with the perpetual zig-zagging of the little bee worker, create this extra tension and the rest is just like that. The scene of the fire is completely in line with his work in ""children of men"" with camera shifting from different points of foci in the same frame.

The film grabs you from the first frame, and doesn’t let you go until the end of its 2:15 run time. Cuarón’s mastery of the camera is evident in scene. Every shot contains so much painstaking detail; you can’t help but feel the passion and commitment that went into this project. Roma, is the story of Cleo who works as a maid for a middle class family in the 1970s. The film documents a year in her life.\tBefore I discuss anything else, let me heap more praise onto what Cuarón did. To take these childhood experiences, and recreate them in such a loving way is something truly special. The writing in this film is simple yet moving. The film really made me care about, and connect with the character of Cleo. Cuarón’s cinematography is something to marvel at as well. Each shot is beautifully presented, and the lighting is top notch all the way through. I could go on about how great the camera work is, but I won’t. Just know it’s something special and go experience it.\tThe performances are all strong. Particularly those of Cleo and Sofía, played by Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira. Both embody the strong female figures that become the focus of the film. Aparicio as a first time actress is particularly impressive, she delivers a powerful performance full of emotion. The acting nominations for these two, were well deserved.\tRoma is a masterpiece. It is the culmination of all the work Alfonso Cuarón has put in throughout his career. I was skeptical going in (mostly due to the fact that it’s a Netflix movie) but I loved every second of it. This movie is a victory for foreign film makers everywhere. It’s a shame the Academy didn't pick Roma as ‘best picture’, because it deserved it more than any of the other nominees.

It is a tribute to women - Cleo, the protagonist, but also all who prominently appear:  The other housekeeper, Adela, as well as the two patrician women in the household (though they are flawed, they are kind and loving overall), right down to the female obstetrician.  On the other hand, we have the men who abandon them and their families; the shooters;  the posers like Fermin who show off to a point that becomes downright ridiculous (you will remember that scene); the ones in military bands who march through the streets for no apparent reason at all ... and who of course are flying the planes that intersect the sky throughout.  In the big martial arts demonstration in the field, who among them is able to execute the pose demonstrated by the teacher?  The martial arts students are all falling over, while (did I see this wrong?  The movie begs repeat viewings) isn't it Cleo, among the women on the sidelines watching all this, who pulls it off?  Is there one likable male character here at all?The ultimate message I got was that it is women who know how to love, while men are absorbed in themselves, to the point of disruption, and the most profound effect of this disparity is on the children.  Women save and nurture while men work against them. The betrayed and abandoned wife says bluntly that women are always alone.  Here, they are in one sense - that men disrespect them and/or fail to even stick around; but the women actually aren't alone.  It's love that binds them to each other, and to the children who could not thrive without them.

Losing one family member often translates to the rest of the family taking on new or unfamiliar roles and responsibilities. The long-term identity of a family (and ultimately, the values and identities of its children) is based on the members who become solidified in that family over several years.

Mumbling the mundane lifestyle of a maid in a mellow vocab, Cuaron has made his best film to date. First thing's first, the notable and yes loud cinematography of his is hauntingly beautiful. No one ever points out the facts that goes behind the camera on screen like such and even though it eerily resonates with Anderson's symmetric camera work, it is a testament of its own for he himself was never able to speak effervescently like such. Speaking of it, there barely resides a stable conversation in here, the bickerings, the murmurings, the gossip, every bit of narration is piled under such pragmatic state of environment. Cuaron speaks through body language and physical sequences, to a point where they themselves become a character.The sequence of a car being parked is so absorbing to encounter it on screen, which then enfolds into another layer of perspective to its intention and then another and then another. Cuaron keeps giving you reason- nay- he challenges you to get disengaged from this humble imbalanced world. And the host that he has selected to narrate this saga is a pure delight on terms of character development. Surprisingly, to write such a character is a daunting task. For its persistency ought to be justified and he does it in here as a mere distraction; kudos to him.Each time the protagonist is helping the younger ones or her employers, Cuaron subconsciously maps out another milestone in your mind. The stillness of a scene staged in a room puts you right there on the spot among the actors, where you have to work your way through to concentrate the gossip or sort out the primary activity in a frame. Amongst many steps that constructs this ingenious behemoth monument called drama, personally that speaks to you is the sort-of-training-camp where Cuaron speaks honestly of his theme without any strings attached.The cast has done a fabulous work, from the lead Aparicio as a humble supporter of this family and Tavira as the real supporter of Aparicio, along with the young cast which may resemble to the younger cast of Malick's The Tree Of Life. But Cuaron's dish is not spiced up with plethora of ingredients like Malick's, his sweetness is competent enough to tick for its course. Cuaron's span spent upon screen is a mesmerizing poem weaved out to clean and scrub a house properly.And boy what a poem it is, dipped into a metaphorical tone, it soars just like those planes hovering around in the background. For the most part of it, Cuaron keeps the frame under the shades, teasing us to seek for the action going on and similar to it the storytelling too feeds on our imagination that is at brisk all the time, especially the last act that scares you with the closure that you are trying to achieve. Roma narrows down cinema to a better quality, Cuaron makes sure it isn't compromised for any reason whatsoever, not even for him.… Expand\n"", '\n¿Porqué no hay cineastas como Cuarón trabajando actualmente en México?

Ran is that kind of film. From the story to the score to the cinematography to the colors, the film is a lyrical and poetic masterpiece from director Akira Kurosawa.

A film about chaos of the mind and the world, Ran develops themes of family, respect, honor, nihilism, and postmodernism.

In this way, Great Lord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) is doomed to watch his lands fall to ruin after opting to trust those that to lie to him, if only because they bowed before him when they did it. Though the sons will be blamed for fracturing the family, in many ways, Hidetora fractured the family and the family was always doomed to fail. As he had three sons, the power struggle would have continued no matter when Hidetora died. In many ways, this could be described as Ran\'s way of showing that our actions do not mean anything (nihilism) and everything is pre-determined for us (free-will or lack thereof). This is even mentioned by one character who says to not blame the gods for what occurs because everything has already been determined. Thus, it can certainly be concluded that the Ichimonji were doomed from the start to fracture. However, by trusting his unfaithful sons over his most faithful son because he spoke his mind, Hidetora merely sped up the demise.Additionally, Ran is an exercise in violence begetting violence. Towards the end, when Hidetora\'s life is one again struck with tragedy at the hands of his son\'s violence towards one another, he asks ""Is there no justice?"" Though his pain is authentic and he is incredibly sympathetic, Hidetora losing his sons to war is justice in its purest form. Throughout the film, we see castles of lords killed by Hidetora. We are introduced to daughters that were witnesses to Hidetora slaughtering their families, only to then be married off to one of Hidetora\'s sons. For Hidetora to suffer as he made others suffer - by watching his family be destroyed - is justice and demonstrates that you ""reap what you sow"" and ""violence begets violence"".Ran also heavily discusses chaos. In fact, its title translates to ""chaos"". Yet, the chaos in the film is two-fold: of the mind and of the world. As he family falls apart, Hidetora goes mad. His mind is very literally chaos. Though he has moments of lucidity, his insanity destroys his mind and memory, causing him to forget what his sons look like and forgetting who a faithful servant was. All of these moments are painful to see, in particular with the servant. Faithful from the beginning, Kyoami (Shinnosuke Ikehata) is distraught to see his master forget who he is and the audience certainly feels his pain. The madness of Hidetora, however, is matched by the now war torn region he is surrounded by. With bloodshed, plots for power, and intrafamily conflicts, there is very little chaos and the film reflects this with long, drawn out battle sequences highlighting every element of brutality. Though chaos appears to happen quickly from the outside, it actually comes from very precise and small steps and Ran goes to great lengths to show the slow descent into chaos experienced by the House of Ichimonji. From plotting wives to power hungry siblings, the collapse is hardly a gradual one.As with many Japanese films, Ran also delves into themes of family, respect, and loyalty. In particular, respect and loyalty are a large element of the film. With long scenes of men showcasing their loyalty by bowing or following their master into battle, Ran develops a constant theme of loyalty. Though some loyal men die, their loyalty is always celebrated, in particular when they do not stay quiet and instead speak their minds. Even if rebuked, they are proven to be right in the end and their original objections were proven to be justified. Had their warnings been headed, the collapse of the Ichimonj would not have happened. As such, Ran could be called a celebration of contrarians. Though they are unpopular figures, the words they speak come from the heart and should be heard clearly, in order to avoid making a fatal error.… Expand\n', ""\n\n            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAkira Kurosawa's final epic, Ran, takes on William Shakespeare's King Lear. To me, from head to toe, this Kurosawa's picture which symbolizes downfall is absolute stunning  such gorgeousness in a film is utterly rare, and of course, it is one of the Kurosawa's many best films. Ran is a success  having nominated for Academy Awards for best art direction, best cinematography, best costume design and best direction and won one. Ran was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.\r I repeat this  Ran, from head to toe, is absolutely stunning, and of course this movie is perfect. The film's cinematography, which is top notch, is a killer. The way Kurosawa captured the images of burning castle, a moving horses, dead soldiers, battle scenes are all undeniably respectable, and sublime too, and one great example would be the scenes where the attack of the third castle was occurring. Very much in evidence that Kurosawa's talent in film-making is transcending. The film's script which was being written by Kurosawa himself, Hideo Oguni and Masato Ide is yet admirable. The exploitation on poetic lines are proved to be effective and fitting for the movie.\r One would see great performances in Ran. Good acting by the players, but to me, the two actors who stood up above the rest are Tatsuya Nakadai and Mieko Harada. Tatsuya Nakadai plays the great lord Tatsuya Nakadai. The great lord is old, fragile and somewhat defenseless and the character is well characterized by him. Mieko Harada plays a female villain Lady Kaede, whose character is hungry for revenge. Her amazing performance which is raw and gripping, plays a very important part for the success of the movie.\r Surely there are several movie elements which are worthy to be carried out for discussions, but to me, the main highlight of Ran is its cinematography, and it is one hell of a show.\r [10/10]\r Facebook (http://facebook.com/alex.desmall) Twitter (@Alex_DeSmall) (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/AlexDesmall)… Expand\n"", '\nWhat makes Ran any different?

All is vanity.”“For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.”“But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the Lord, and be sure your sin will find you out.”What a difference 33 years makes(Duh!) When I first saw this movie in 1985 I just knew if was a great movie. I was totally captivated by the Attack on the Third Castle(which I still am) but it has now become obvious to me how all truly great works of art are hopelessly(hopefully?) entangled with the Biblical worldview(even if the director doesn’t embrace that view.) Although you would expect Kurosawa to be a Buddhist he seems to acknowledge that the Eightfold Path does not succeed in conquering suffering. Indeed, the son who returns at the end does “not” cure the chaos(oh how Kurosawa could have used the conquering Messiah of the Christian faith here!) Tsurumaru’s drop of the Amira Buddha image near the end also seems to indicate a lack of faith in the Buddhist way.But the other Christian themes reflected in the quotes above are beautifully explored here.Mise en scène Score(20/20) Kurosawa is a master here. The scene in which Hidetora exits the Second Castle is gorgeous. As is the overhead shot in the ruins with Hidetora and Kyoami. Although the Attack on the Third Castle is not static there are many powerful images here as well. The final shot of Tsurumaru matches the bleakness of the final shot in Vertigo, and repeats the theme of a fall from great height(The Garden of Eden?)The Attack on the Third Castle(30/30) If this isn’t the greatest sequence in movie history it is surely the greatest sequence without dialogue. How can such carnage be so captivatingly presented? This type of “operatic” violence is what Peckinpah presents at the end of “Wild Bunch” but raised to a higher degree.Proverbs 22:6 Score(30/30) The inverse holds true as well. Even though Saburo escapes this tendency(by the grace of God?) he can’t save the day in the end.Revenge vs. Forgiveness/Loyalty Score(10/10) The sins of Hidetora, Taro and Jiro come full circle as Lady Kaede takes her revenge. But Lady Sué’s way of forgiveness, and the loyalty of Tango and Kyoami, stand out as the way forward.Acting Score(4/5) Hidetora’s death seemed overacted to me.Worldview Score(4/5) Perfect presentation of our hopeless state without God.

I wish I can bring up every single actors name in this cast but I'm not since these 12 of them and it's going to take up the all page and I can't talk about every singe actor and go into detail about them one at a time, but I can say that everyone in the movie did a flawless work of acting that's pure Oscar worthy and the kind of drama acting they should show kids in drama school. Nicely done fellas.Sidney Lumet directed this movie and this has to be some of the best directing I've seen from this guy. He really added a lot to this movie when it came to story and characters and the back and forward they have with each other and it worked by his direction.The characters in the movie (The Twelve Angry Men) don't really like each that much as in every scene they at each other's throat trying to confidence the other men in the room that the man is guilty for murder while that person and the other's bring up some really solid points that this man is guilty or not guilty for murder. As a viewer myself I got really interested in the case and trying to think if he's guilty or not, so this movie does a fantastic job of giving the viewer a opinion on the case and see if you think he did it or not.For problems with the movie: I don't have any.Overall 12 Angry Men is such a classic movie with excellent performances from everyone, the writing outstanding and the directing was some of the best.

The dialogue is interesting as well, the characters have interesting lines and they move the film along interestingly.However, the movie is one in which very bad things happen to people and are accentuated by smaller bad things happening to them. Intellectually I understand this is a great movie. The book is about a group of aimless characters who drift through life, drift through the movie and then drift out. They have no purpose just like this movie. I know you are probably reading this and wondering ""Why is he giving this an eight if he doesn\'t have anything good to say about it?"" Well objectively speaking I believe there are many elements which go into making a film really good : acting, directing, sound, plot. From a technical and objective perspective this movie is excellent. It is an extremely well made, well acted and technically well done film. However, i never really felt invested in the movie. I didn\'t want the movie to end up being some hackneyed film where the character finds redemption, find a new love in his old city, and moves forward in some way. But at the same time I wish there was more to it.… Expand\n', '\nManchester by the Sea is a very touching human drama, marked by loyalty to reality.

If anything about good and evil, right or wrong, morality in general is touched upon, it is strictly restrained to moral relativism, where it\'s always ""up to the viewer"" to form their own feelings, the filmmaker tries not to offer the slightest clue about his or her stance on the issues. Pretty much every last ""critically acclaimed"" TV show these days falls under this category, and a plethora of movies, Manchester by the Sea being the most recent example of the ones I have seen, though it\'s really not about one or two examples.The issue I have with this ""non judgmental"" trend is that I firmly believe art, truly great art, should in some shape or form benefit society, not simply present it ""as is."" When society celebrates stories of moral relativism, it adopts moral relativism. Things that were, and for good reason, seen as clearly wrong, suddenly become ""complex,"" up for personal interpretation, depending on ""circumstance."" And if challenged, the excuse is always ""oh I\'m not endorsing this, I\'m just portraying real life without judging. This is what people do.""But when art abandons teaching moral messages, that contributes to society becoming morally anchorless and losing its scope of what\'s right or wrong. No, this definitely is not an argument about ""violent movies influence violence in real life"" or anything of the sort - it\'s not about what is portrayed, but how it is portrayed. And morality seems to have been sacrificed by many filmmakers on the altar of realism, with both public and critical acclaim embracing this with both arms.… Expand\n', ""\nAffleck has done the impossible - dramatized an interior pain in a consistently affecting manner.

People handle it in different ways and Lee (Casey Affleck) becomes a totally cold, uncaring person who cuts himself off from all those he loves, leaves his hometown, gets a job as a janitor in Boston, drinks a lot of beer and has fights in bars.The first hour of the film deals with Lee before and after the tragedy, how he was a happy man, father, husband, brother and friend before he became the loner he is now. After his brother, Joe, (Kyle Chandler) dies, he comes home to find out that Joe has appointed Lee the guardian of his 16 year old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) who in many ways is a typical teenager but is acting out upon the death of his father. At this point the director/screenwriter, Kenneth Lonergan, tells us what the tragedy was and it is almost to painful for the audience to hear and watch. For the next hour and 17 minutes we see how uncle and nephew interact and deal with life, Patrick with humor and sarcasm, Lee without emotions and staying as uninvolved as he can stay. We meet Patrick\'s mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) who has been out of his life for years, her new husband Jefferey (Matthew Broderick) Lee\'s ex-business partner and friend George (C. J. Wilson) but most important of all Lee\'s ex-wife, Randi (Michelle Williams).While Affleck is getting all the attention in the reviews I was more impressed with 20 year old Lucas Hedges as the 16 year old who can break your heart and a second later having you laugh. Affleck does a strong job especially since most of his scenes have to be done in a monotone, showing no emotion and fighting the pull his nephew on has him as a human being.Michelle Williams has a very emotional scene, lasting about 5 minutes, with Casey Affleck but as easily as I am moved in a movie\'s emotionally scenes, this didn\'t move me.Gretchen Mol is wasted and Matthew Broderick has a very thankless part. The rest of the supporting players including  Patrick\'s main girlfriend played by Anna Baryshnikov are all above par.I love heavy, family, movie dramas but the bottom line is that ""Manchester by the Sea"" is way too long by 15-20 minutes which doesn\'t make for very much tension and though the scenery of Manchester by the Sea is excellent in all the seasons and there is no fault with the acting I don\'t recommend it.Oh, yes, a very distracting soundtrack that more than once takes you out of the story.… Expand\n', ""\nmindblowing.

TheSir Alfred Hitchcock once said, ""I don\'t make slices of life pictures.  I prefer slices of cake.""  This is a prime example of why he expressed that sentiment and why he was the Master, and why so many are students of his to this day.  The filmmakers of this little indie slice of life film are not.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it is naive not to realize the tenants of suspense apply to all stories and genres, that any good movie needs some form of imagination.The writer/director here is trying to pass off a lazy, half baked, self indulgent, contrived excuse for a movie that is very slow, dreadfully boring, poorly edited (in the sense of economy of running time), and unevenly acted (at times it\'s naturalistic and real, while at others it\'s painfully forced and phony, with Casey Affleck delivering a suitably competent performance but certainly not outstanding by any sane measure)... and the critics just ate it up!  They swallowed the pretentious void of story craft and lack of dynamics hook, line and sinker, as the herd on the scent of pretentious art films does, so often mistaking the pretense of art for actual accomplished audience pleasing work, or even difficult opaque but still highly worthy endeavors that require work on the audience\'s part.  This thing is neither.  Moviemakers should always work for the audience, not the other way around.  That means even with difficult, challenging or disturbing material the work of story craft in a narrative must be done before it\'s given to the audience.  To just throw up on screen some ramblings and musings (no matter how tragic or melancholic) that a screenwriter jacked off on the page and called it a day is no excuse for the lack of quality entertainment or ""art"" in any genuine sense of the word when it comes to the cinema.Of course The Academy flock will also delight full course on this unpalatable slice of s--- too.

The acting is grounded and always character consistent. The character consistency is the key to the overall film’s success. Kenneth Lonergan’s directorial accomplishment is utilized to anchor moments that might otherwise be drama cliche. The character consistency would, of course, be an even more impossible task without an excellent cast. Casey Affleck will undoubtedly get the quarterback like attention at the Oscars. What that comment means is I failed to see a single bad performance from the rest of the cast. For narrative, the contemplative structure allows the viewer a chance of gaining character insight without letting moments explicitly define the players. A tragic event will occur and a given scene only allows a character minor fallout before a transition in time. The cinematography is fine with an excellent focus on the little quirks one might find in a small New England town. In addition, the blend of cinematography and location lends to the rare cinematic experience of a story feeling like it came from a genuine place. Manchester is an uncomfortable film when it comes to dishing out any form of conclusion. The result is a narrative more in line with postmodern sensibilities. The ending can easily be dismissed as a typical indie climax. However, the conclusion is anything but a simple artistic gimmick. Seeing the ending as a gimmick robs rewarding the narrative of its logical continuation. In fact, I daresay Manchester by the Sea contains one of the year\'s best movie endings. To summarize, the butterfly-like effect of grief is the central theme I pinned down. The question, ""Do I deserve forgiveness?"" is also asked. I can’t say I admired the film as much on a personal level. The film contained a lot of scenes which were a little long for my taste. Additionally, the movie works better as an example of fine filmmaking over anything I can take with me in life. Many people will see the film as a relatable experience but nothing more.

Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea is easily the best film this year. I guess I should start with the acting, which is also the best this year.

This melodic view takes us from here through the uncle’s cold spiritual journey of knowing his place amidst the chaos of death.Manchester by the Sea is written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan (Gangs of New York), whose hard work shows in how deep he is willing to dive into the darkest corners of everyone we meet throughout his record of memories. The lonely, depressed, recently divorced plumber we are invited to connect with has a lot coming at him; having lost his brother to cardiac arrest, and now left to be the only one left to take in custody of his now fatherless nephew.\u200bFrom watching the heartbreaking flashbacks that depict the uncertainty of the plumber’s path, to the humbling, somber performance by Casey Affleck (no tears necessary), all audiences suited for the well-earned R-rating will be greatly moved by its rough depiction of an everyday story within an everyday life.What makes the chilling power of this deceptively simple story so powerful is the consistently cold feel that Lonergan maintains from start to finish. Being set in the northeast, snow appears all over to reflect the plumber’s state of mind, and the cold is felt all the greater depending on the amount of stress tugging between him and his blood relatives. The screen’s empty starkness takes its time to linger on the quietest of moments, screaming the loudest of internal noises without saying a word.Manchester by the Sea could have easily taken place anywhere in the world, not necessarily in one particular small town in one particular part of the nation. What makes the Boston-Manchester setting work to its advantage is its subtle handling of the culture, right down to the look, feel, and taste of the area. The much-needed emphasis on father and son bonding through the quietness of fishing bookends the film with the one single image that defines everything valued by the people who live there. Also similar to last year’s big Oscar-winner Spotlight, there is a clear presence of Catholicism guiding the lives of all Bostonians, whether or not they consider themselves religious. They claim that all Catholics are Christian, which is not believed to be entirely true by everyone, nor is it said so in the feature, but it works to the advantage of making the sense of hope they seek after touch much closer to home.There are plenty of independent features out there that tackle the discomforting subject of family death and custody, but none of them handle it with the same level of detail, humanity, and personal application as Manchester by the Sea. It’s not the feel-good holiday treat you may be looking for this time of year, but considering how family and tragedy essentially go hand-in-hand, Lonergan’s scholarly study on the personal crisis will help countless others in what to do about a similar trauma.Hence, I encourage all to see this masterful, humbling work when they get the chance to, but not just with anyone, with the relatives they are the closest to. That way, you can walk out of the theater together sharing the tears of your worst and best memories.

His work on execution too, is appreciative if not completely justified considering the potential of the script. On performance, Mia Farrow grows on you as it ages on screen but unfortunately isn't supported well enough except for Ruth Gordon's stellar performance.

This film is probably one of the most notorious andRoman Polanski is a classic and his long career has consecrated him as one of the most influential directors of the twentieth century, although I don't have any sympathy for him as a person. This film is probably one of the most notorious and acclaimed of his career, and rightly so. When it debuted, in the late sixties, it was scary and I fully understand why. More than other horror movies so far, it used the permanent tension to keep the audience in absolute discomfort, not to mention that danger around a baby is something that touches the emotional side of anyone. It's something innate. The story takes place in an apartment building and revolves around Rosemary, a young woman who impregnates after having had a mysterious nightmare, when something possessed her sexually. Finally, other revelations, and the attitudes of a couple of elderly seemingly loving neighbors, convince her that she expects a son of the Devil, the Antichrist himself. Terrifying, is not? With such a good script it was easy to succeed, especially when Polanski so cleverly uses visual and sound effects as well as cinematography, misty and dense. Everything was thoughtfully designed to make us tense. Rape scenes are worthy of anthology. Today, by themselves, they don't scare us, horror movies have been so full of gore and blood that these scenes have lost their strength, but if we embed them in the film, they contribute a lot to our discomfort. Mia Farrow was at the highest level during the film, perhaps the most controversial of her career, since neither her husband supported her. Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon glared at the Castevets, the movie's villains. John Cassavetes is more restrained but does very well with his role. At present, this movie may not scare you as much as it scared you in the past, everything has its expiration date, but it remains one of the great classics of horror and must have a place on the shelf of any lover of this movie genre.… Expand\n"", ""\nI had a really tough time getting into this movie.

Mia Farrow asRosemary's Baby is a horror film made in 1968 and directed by Roman Polanski but whether it's a drama aswell as a horror I don't know however that would explain the slow acted pace and countless conversations in the film. Mia Farrow as Rosemary was odd at times but I personally think she did a great job in her role and she's genuinely a great actress but there's a few problems with Rosemary's Baby. For starters you never see the baby or any baby but there's scenes where you know she's pregnant and what's going on and secondly the story makes no sense. Another bad thing is the film has a rotten ending and makes little sense at all, the plots all over the place, some of the characters are weak and some of the acting is shabby. For a horror film to work you don't necessarily need blood and guts or a dude going round stabbing people but you do need something to grab the audience's attention and to shock or scare and Rosemary's Baby had nothing. Rosemary's Baby felt like a drama all the way through and nothing in the movie suggests it's a horror movie and at times it's very boring and mainly focuses on a plot against the baby which gets tedious and pointless conversations that never stop or stop and hop to some more dialog and conversations. There's no blood in Rosemary's Baby except for the death of some woman which is very little, no suspense, tension, no shocks, twists, nothing and certainly nothing scary about it because it feels like a long drama film mainly just consisting of conspiracy's or conspiracy theories and conversations after conversations. It's a long and tedious film at times and I wasn't impressed especially for a horror and this film is plain bad. Not even Mia Farrow can save this in my eyes and Roman Polanski can't make horrors. Simple as that and sadly Rosemary's Baby is a tragic film that is basically a road to nowhere. The films beautifully directed and some of it's enjoyable but it gets dull and overlong with very little to keep the viewer interested if anything only to throw down one of the worst and stupidest endings in movie history which disappoints and your left wondering is this the final climax I waited for?

A lot of directors have come and gone, but none of them was just reading it to you, tucking you in, he whispers the book in his infamous adaptation like it is his, the director\'s, John Huston. The story, if you are aware of it, has been wielded before too, but it didn\'t come out this durable and.. well, shiny. The narration is a bit tricky in here, since it is something that would- I wanna say be better if on paper, because it is and it was good- resist if exaggerated.The scenarios, the characters, the entire tone of this film-noir is bound within four walls. It ping-pongs here are there with ""He said. She said"" affair where as an audience you are in a rush to figure out what actually is going on or has been going on in this first act. After which the film reveals all its cards and we relaxed back in our seats, hoping for something ""Bang!"" to go wrong. But it doesn\'t. This is where the film cheated me the most and left me in awe of it.For if I think about it I never wanted it to go wrong or right or in fact anywhere. Huston\'s filmmaking is so present in that room where around three to four major characters are sitting around or roaming about that you don\'t want this day to end. Anticipation is the game then, and the tease, is Huston\'s key to success.

It is a style that even today has passionate and faithful followers, and sometimes reappears in cinema, whether in the form of simple tributes or even in the form of a kind of ""neo noir"" that we can see in films like ""Shutter Island"", ""The Black Dahlia"" or ""Mulholland Drive"".The story of this film revolves around a statuette of a falcon, made of gold and precious stones, an ancient artifact that an order of knights - which the film clarifies at the outset to be ""the Knights Templar of Malta"" (I will talk about this later) - offers in the 16th century to Emperor Charles V in exchange for the Mediterranean island of Malta. According to the story of this film, the object was lost and never reaches the hands of the emperor. In this film its the search for the artifact that motivates a crime that is investigated by a detective, alongside the police.The biggest problem I had with this film lies in the historical premises on which the script was built. It may seem petty, but I am a historian and I value a certain historical rigour. That is why the expression ""Knights Templar of Malta"" gives me chills of horror as it mixes and confuses two orders of cavalry that should not be confused. One is the Order of the Temple, or the Knights Templar, which has nothing to do with this film, and the other is the Order of the Hospital, or Order of Malta. The Knights Templar were founded after the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099, at the end of the First Crusade. The order became very rich, acquired land, prestige and power, aroused envy. Persecuted by the French king Philip IV, it was extinguished by Pope Clement V in 1312. The Order of the Knights of St. John, or Knights Hospitallers, was also founded after the conquest of Jerusalem and also enriched but was never extinct and still exists today, with another name: Sovereign and Military Order of Malta. This is due to the fact that, when Jerusalem was lost by the Christians, the knights moved their headquarters to Cyprus, then to the island of Rhodes until, finally, they settled on Malta in 1518. The island, then part of the territories of the Crown of Aragon, was ruled by the Germanic emperor Charles V, who was also the king of Castile, Leon and Aragon (today Spain), as Charles I. Calling Templars to the Hospitallers Knights is, thus, a gross history error, almost like saying that Lincoln founded the United States of America, or that Napoleon I was the last king of France.The film is dominated by the presence of Humphrey Bogart. A great actor from the golden age, he is excellent and I just found it difficult to keep up with him when he accelerated his speech and ran over words, making it difficult to understand what he was saying. I also liked the performance of Gladys George and Mary Astor, which surprises us in the end with an interesting but somewhat obvious twist. In turn, the character of Peter Lorre struck me as a bit of a caricature. The film has a lot of dialogue and it can be a bit boring, especially for those who expect a little action, but I handled it well except for Bogart, as I said.Technically, its a discreet but very competent film, with quality production values. It has excellent cinematography, with impeccable and original shooting angles and camera work. Its relatively high contrast looks good on the screen and makes the film visually pleasing. The light and shadow effects and lighting are truly superb. The sets are routine but elegant, the costumes are excellent with all the raincoats and fedora hats we could wish for.

(When it ended, nobody in my theater moved for a period of time, and there was no round of applause  mostly, it seemed, because of the shock of it all. Clapping didn’t seem like the right thing to do.)  The fact that we experience the story from the perspective of a kidnapped free man makes the film instantly relatable.

When the boat transporting the kidnapped south moves, you see the paddlewheels. On the plantations, you see the three or four acres where the slaves live.  You never get any aerial shots, which is so effective in giving you a disoriented, lost feel.  Even if Solomon wants to escape, he has no idea where the hell he is, and neither do we.

It was well researched and refrained from creating drama to add spice.\r From the very first scene, McQueen wastes no time in plunging us into the daily, ordinary lives of black slaves of the nineteenth century Deep South. Interlaced with the present story that we're being shown where the protagonist, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), is already a slave, a series of flashbacks flesh out his previous life as a free man in the North. He has a wife and kids, and leads a normal life just like the white people who surround him. He is introduced to people who promise him good income as a violinist in the capital. He agrees and leaves his family behind in New York for an intended period of two weeks. He is lulled into a false sense of security and drinks more than he should have. When he wakes up he finds himself in chains confronted by men who insist on calling him a slave.\r I got the impression that those of the African extraction who were born free are inherently different from those who were born into slavery. They think and speak freely and have a different view to life. Those who were born into slavery seem to have embraced their fate. There was an interesting scene where a slave walks into a shop and stares in amazement at Northup when he was a free man in New York.\r Paul Giamatti plays a slave-trader who has them stand naked as potential customers roam about and inspect them before making a purchase. He divides children from their mothers without a second thought. It is here that Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) buys Northup. McQueen doesn't take it easy on the children we have seen just because we might have developed sympathy for them, for to do so would be a gross betrayal to the ones whose stories no one narrated and their anguish never revealed, and to keep them safe would suggest that this was the norm where in reality it might have been an exception.\r John Tibeats (Paul Dano) comes across as someone who never might have thought about the ethics of slavery once in his life. He is instantly recognizable. There are a lot of people like him who go about their lives without letting their thoughts stray into areas that demand serious discussions like philosophy, the arts, poverty, war etc. They came into this world to lead their lives like sheep, eating well, wearing and spending extravagantly, and having a general good time. If they were picked up and dropped into a time when slavery was legal, they would not once flinch or utter a word against it as long as they belonged to the group that was doing the slaving. Tibeats resents the fact that Ford has grown fond of Northup, and the latter's quick wit and high words offend him.\r Northup's next owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), puts him to picking cotton in the fields with his other slaves. He derives his own interpretations from the Bible sanctioning slavery, and lashes them accordingly. Sometimes he has them brought into the house in the middle of the night and dance around. Epps's wife is jealous of a slave girl and abuses her constantly. She can't seem to grasp the fact that if her husband paid special attention to a slave, it was his fault and not the latter's. She constantly threatens the slaves and taunts her husband to be more tough on them to keep them in line. When she offers them respite, she expects gratitude. Husband and wife bring the worst out of each other. But Epps is the epitome of psychopathy. He bullies with his every word. It is a constant struggle for Northup not to incite anger and have his master lunge at him with murderous intention.\r Deaths among the slaves happen without any alarm being raised. Some of the black people have had it easy on them courtesy of their owners. They even had servants and slaves serving them in a few cases. Northup becomes a part of the community, but he still tries to reach his family and friends somehow to inform them about his situation. He trusts in someone who betrays him, and barely escapes death. Northup is finally able to reunite with his family, but not before we witness possibly some of the worst scenes of barbarity displayed anywhere on film.\r At moments the score is so quiet it's almost imperceptible, but complements the scenes perfectly. The production design and costume design paints a vivid picture of the time. There's a simplicity and mundaneness to everything from the way the slaves toil everyday to their time spent privately. The film was edited with ingenuity. Both narratives develop side by side and complement each other. Instead of a beginning where we might have wondered when Northup was going to be banged up, we see him as a slave from the very first shot. And the flashbacks only come when they are relevant to the present story. Northup's character development was palpable and poignant.\r McQueen has promoted himself to the A-list with this masterpiece of the highest order.… Expand\n"", '\nThis is breathtakingly well made with top notch performances up and down the cast, but without a doubt the toughest film to watch of the year.

After all, the film experience should be pleasurable and something to enjoy. Nevertheless, I took the opportunity to view the film on a DVD a friend generously loaned to us. As I watched the film my concerns were indeed realized for some of the scenes were certainly uncomfortable to watch. However It was worth the 10 or 15 total minutes of discomfort to be able to be artistically exhilarated as we saw inhumanity and dignity oppose each other in what was the then mentality and norm of the slave genre and the society that embraced it. The acting of Chiwitel Ejifor, the writing of John Ridley and the direction of Steve McQueen make this a rewarding theatrical experience which the viewer will find difficult to forget or even equal. The film tells the true story of Solomon Northup, a cultured and well respected African American northerner, who is kidnapped and then sold into slavery by his abductors and ends up spending 12 years on one or more southern plantations. It’s easy for an audience member, black or white, to identify with the lead character and that is what makes the film work so well.  Massive suffering among thousands is a broad and almost meaningless phrase when compared to describing the plight of one individual. It is something the viewer can more readily identify with and understand. I give this film a 9. To those who may still be reluctant to see it, think of it as historical medicine.

The entire film is a cinematic masterpiece, and will leave you in silence upon finishing it, simply due to the realism and shock of it all. Steve McQueen has taken this true story and provided it with complete justice in a movie form, and he had no intentions of making light scenes. Each and every scene of this movie is full of emotion and the actors/actresses portray their feelings outstandingly well, I'd be very surprised if Chiwetel Ejiofor didn't win an award for playing the role of Solomon Northup. Unlike typical movies which are full of soundtracks and constantly changing scenes flashing before your eyes, this movie sets a very silent and extended form of scenery. There are moments in the film where all you are seeing is Solomon's face with nothing but silence, and it causes you to really read and understand the emotion in his face. The brutal scenes in which the slave's 'masters' are punishing them are also extremely powerful, and you as the audience are forced to witness prolonged scenes of horrific torture, the reality of it really does hit you hard. What I like about this film is the way it focuses so closely upon a handful of characters. The scope of the scenes never goes beyond Solomon, or the cotton farm in which the majority of the film is set in. By following the characters so closely, and portraying their emotions throughout, you develop an extremely sympathetic bond with the Solomon and his co-slaves, which very few movies I've seen can do. If you are reading this and haven't seen 12 Years a Slave, you must see it. The film does take a bit of stomach to watch, and you should also be prepared for the shock and reality of it, but in my eyes it is a must see.

One man's food and all that aside, the performances, script and cinematography couldn't possibly warrant such critical reviews. One reviewer (Englishrose),  sees the movie as  presenting a challenge to criticise it or (sic - and) be condemned a racist, and lambasts McQueen for  gratuitous violence. This misses the point. The violence is indeed brutal, and the threat of it, at least, relentless, but not without reason. It is necessary in portraying the barbaric nature of the antebellum slavery in its attempts to dehumanise a people.\r The reviewer complains that the film plunges too quickly into the risky details, but we learn enough about Solomon to establish the character pre his ordeal. Condensing twelve years of slavery into a couple of hours requires keen editing. Besides, the reviewer's sense of time is a bit dubious in remembering a beating scene as twenty minutes long, which was in fact only several minutes.\r The director is censured by these reviewers for its oversimplified depiction of of white men as  evil and black as good, but the reality is far more complex. The story is not so much a collective disparaging of white people as a sobering tale of the cruelty all people are capable of when the law approbates their behaviour.\r There are questions as to why Solomon doesn't attempt an earlier escape, but these simply aren't grounded in reality. When the likelyhood of successful emancipation is so small and the punishments for failed attempts so horrific, it does not take a great leap of imagination to see why so few slaves/captives make a genuine bid for freedom.\r The film will no doubt leave viewers with different feelings, but sanctimoniousness is unlikely to be one of them.… Expand\n"", '\nThe film is lengthy and it did lose me about halfway/three-fourths of the way win but when it had me it had me by the balls.

Fassbender, McQueen’s fixed leading man, lends himself to the meaty villain role, the outright racist plantation owner Edwin Epps,the dichotomy of his libido-driven infatuation with the young slave girl Patsey (Nyong’o) and the iron-clad truth she will never be completely his possession, is the centrepiece which culminates in an appalling whipping sequence where McQueen unbendingly fixates on Patsey’s heartbreaking wail and the horrid lacerations, Nyong’o is no doubt meritorious for her Oscar-win with her debut, her final scene when seeing off Solomon to his freedom with both yearning (for herself) and felicity (for him) has been encapsulated with pitch perfect verisimilitude.\r Further on, besides those three Oscar-nominated lucky ones, it is a handful of under-praised but equally memorable performances, Sarah Paulson (Mistress Epps), Alfre Woodard (Mistress Shaw) and Adepero Oduye (Eliza) all steal the limelight when their meagre screen-time is on, Paulson is brilliant with her glacial frigidity and sharp callousness, Woodard nails the most ambiguous role in the film with her composed utterance and Oduye brings about a burst of volcanic theatricality in her tête-à-tête with Ejiofor. By contrast, the other male side players are less prominent, Pitt is the ultimate messiah for Solomon, but reservedly underlit, and Paul Dano is on the verge of being typecast as someone either compulsively creepy or maddening annoying.\r John Ridley’s stern screenplay (the third Oscar win for the film) prunes the prolonged odyssey into a number of key chapters, carves out a clarified narrative arc while enlivening the jaded souls with terse lines full of understated connotations; Hans Zimmer’s score mingles with the movie’s awe-inspiring presentation of a history should never be forgotten, tallies with the credence of viewers’ spontaneity, unobtrusive, but superbly competent alongside this epic voyage, if you can stick to the very end, it is a film can sublimate your moral sentience, and Steve McQueen is a filmic wizard of sublime gravitas, at the age of 45, we can optimistically hope that his best has yet to come.… Expand\n', '\nEs casi una obra maestra, mi unica critica negativa es en los momentos largos de secuencia que muestra\rel sufrimiento y algunas escenas que pueden volverse muy tediosas.\n', '\nFilming harrowing memories of Solomon Northup.

Soloman Northup, a free African American, is lured by two circus men who promise him work as a musician. However, his whole world is turned upside down when he wakes up in shackles and on the wrong end of the black slave trade. Not a movie for the light-hearted, it features various scenes of black people being tortured, whipped, raped, and forced to stand still with no clothes on while they are inspected and sold off for a price to their new white masters (the proceeds of which they will never see a dime of). The depressing storyline aside, the film emanates with flowing nineteenth century frocks and settings, but it is Chiwetel Ejiofor as a brilliant solo piece that completes the film. We follow him throughout his 12 years as a slave, and his tight-lipped performance brews an emotional storm of helplessness but also hope in those who watch it. Not being able to speak out much, especially in the company of his various overseers, leaves a lot of work to his body language, and he makes it work.

How is this man not a celebrated Hero (Not just African American but of all Americans in general).\r A lot of Critics that i have read said that Brad Pitt's role as Bass in the film was very small. I completely disagree, He greatly shows the contrast and contradiction in the Failed logic of slavery, and the dehumanization of it.

This is manifested in several different ways, and the actors did an amazing job portraying there frustration for the situation they found themselves in. Mentally what the slaves had to endure, is completely unfathomable, this is apparent in several scenes throughout the film, just to endure the situations they are put in, it's clear they have to detach themselves and do the most unspeakable things to survive.

A New Yorker Solomon Northup, a born-free black American was kidnapped and sold into slavery. So his journey into the dark world begins after he was assigned to work in various fields. It was incredible and unbelievable sad journey of those 12 years till he gets his freedom back.\r After the movie 'Shame' Steve McQueen retained his favourite actor Michale Fassbender to play in a prominent role for the third time for this historical epic drama.

The pompous critic remembers why he loves food, as this dazzling comedy(you forget you\'re watching an animated picture) reminds us why we love the movies. ""Ratatouille"" is so sophisticated, there\'s an extra tier of sophistication that will fly under the radar of most moviegoers. ""Ratatouille"", to my utter disbelief, has references to the Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan and his film ""Felicia\'s Journey"". Ian Holm, who voices the role of Skinner, the chef in exile, was in Egoyan\'s ""The Sweet Hereafter"". This is such tremendous fun for cineastes because we can\'t understand why it\'s there in the first place. This piece of trivia is irrelevant to enjoying ""Ratatouille"", but the references are there, nevertheless. In an ordinary film, it\'s Linguini(voiced by Lou Romano) who\'d be delusional(that a rat is actually doing the cooking), but in ""Ratatouille"", it\'s the delusion(from Skinner\'s point-of-view(he\'s the first person to see the rat); Skinner, who reminds me of that single person who sees the duck in those Aflac commercials) who has delusions(Chef Gusteau is Remy\'s muse). ""Ratatouille"" also has references to Carol Emschwiller\'s novel ""The Mount"" and Gary Larson\'s ""The Far Side"". And if you remember Ralph Fiennes\' wine cellar speech to Embeth Davidtz in ""Schindler\'s List"", ""Ratatouille"" can be interpreted as a fantastical parable that sutures the rift between Jews and Germans.

I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film’s message is a little on the nose but I don’t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film’s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film’s story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It’s so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it’s always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I’m using the word tension a lot but that’s what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year.

In his earlier films “Okja” (2017) and “Snowpiercer” (2013),In “Parasite,” Writer/Director Bong Joon Ho continues his critique of capitalist economies that, in his judgment, inevitably create economic divides resulting in class warfare.  In his earlier films “Okja” (2017) and “Snowpiercer” (2013), Bong used a platform of science fiction to soften the message.  With “Parasite,” he employs slapstick and dark humor to leaven a story that, in lesser hands, might have become painfully didactic.Setting his story in Seoul, Bong has the benefit of dealing with class warfare and economic inequality without the complication of race.  South Korea is one of the most ethnically homogeneous countries in the world – 96% of the population is Korean.Bong’s pacing of his story is impeccable.  In Act One, we are introduced to the Kim family, literally and figuratively living in the lower reaches of the city, the parents unemployed and struggling, the kids getting by on street smarts.  When workers come by spraying white clouds of pesticide in their rodent-infested section of the city, the father advises to leave the windows open:  “It’s free extermination.”  At the other end of the economic spectrum is the Park family, wealthy beyond reason and totally reliant on others to do anything requiring physical or mental heavy lifting.  Bong underlines his premise by conveying clearly that, while they have great wealth, the Parks are not endowed with a particularly high level of intelligence, common sense or self-awareness.When a wealthy friend of the Kim son creates an opportunity for him to tutor the Park daughter, the Kims use this entry point as leverage, creating jobs for every member of the family within the Park household.  So far, the story, is light, bright and slapstick, with only a small vein of dark humor.  This tone offers opportunities for non-threatening exposition.  Remarking on the Parks’ unlined faces, Mr. Kim intones: “Money is like an iron.  It smooths the creases out.”In Act Two, the story takes a darker turn, initially by exploring the consequences of the Kims’ actions on one of the displaced workers.  By the end of the film, class warfare has escalated from bland observations (Mr. Park observes that those who ride on the subway have a “special smell”) to full-on emotional and physical violence.  For me, Bong’s thoughtful, subtly-crafted story invoked a fair amount of thought and introspection.“Parasite” won the top prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival and is South Korea’s entry for Best International Feature Film at the Oscars.

Winner of the Palme d'Or (the French equivalent of an Academy Award) earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival, this film follows a poor Korean family that attempts to insert themselves into the lives of a rich, upper-class suburban family by getting themselves hired for various jobs for the family, such as a math tudor, chauffeur, cook, etc. They seem intent on even replacing the family and claiming the house for themselves if possible, until they stumble upon something shocking and unexpected within the house.

Bong captures the tension of class disparity superbly, blending grittiness, humour and horror, and striking imagery that completely immerses you in the world he created. The actors all do a superb job, especially Kang Ho-Song, who best exemplifies through his performance, what it feels like to be on the less-fortunate end of the class spectrum. The writing is superb too, in particular how it portrays the struggle to move up the class ladder, using both the optimistic practicality of ""planning"" and pessimistic impracticality of ""dreaming"", in a hard-hitting way. This movie forces you to ride the wave with our main characters, all the way up, and down.The cinematography is beautiful, and the images composed superbly. The way the cinematography captures the architecture of our more-fortunate characters home is breathtaking, so is their lifestyle. No wonder our main characters plot and dream of being in that position, who wouldn\'t want to be?. The score stands out too.

What starts as an endearing tale of a crooked family drama (which gets a bit long in the tooth) takes a hard right into 'lets see how long they can play hide and seek in the house' all the way to 'metaphorical homeless guy lives in the basement and worships the upperclass homeowner'....

But this time it has been different. When I saw the huge amount of Academy Awards ""Parasite"" was recieving, I felt the immediate need to see it. And I won\'t ever regret it.""Parasite"", directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a perfect mix of black comedy, thriller, drama and social critic. It just has everything. The title is also magnificent. It makes you think that you\'ll see South Korea battling against ""coronavirus"" but no; you\'ll watch a capturing movie where the word ""parasite"" will recieve another deep meaning: the way poor people are seen by the rich class and how someone opposed to you is a kind of virus inside your house; something that doesn\'t fit in, that does not belong here nor isn\'t welcomed.This film is, by far, a must-see for cinema lovers since it has all factors that make a movie perfect.

The film is more or less divided into two major sections:the first half of the film follows a Family living in the poor areas of Seoul (im assuming). After the son Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-shik)is given the opportunity to work as an English tutor in an extremely rich household, he begins to realize that despite having a great income, the adults of the family are not exactly the brightest of induviduals, and so slowly Ki-Woo and his family devise a plan to all come into the employment of their new wealthy acquaintances. Although the film may give a lighthearted impression, once the movie transitions into the second half it becomes extraordinarily twisted, slightly resembling the ending of Robert Eggers's 'The Lighthouse'.After contemplating the events that took place witin the film, It seems obvious to me that Like JB Priestley's 'An Inspector Calls', Bong Joon-ho intends for this movie to display a clear contast between the lives of the rich and the struggles of the poor within this obviously unjust society. Of course it doesn't just rub your face with morals, and there is a very substantial and entertaining plot, but this is one of the main focuses of the movie.As for the other, i'd say that would be the excellent dynamic between characters which is further developed by the brilliant performances from every cast member, particularly Park So-dam who in my opinion was robbed of a Best supporting actress nomination. Other notable features include some top of the line cinematography and a outstanding writing, but other than that I feel there isn't much to talk about.Parasite is an absolute masterpiece, and like so many other films that have come out recently I absolutely recommend it.Fun fact: Elon Musk officially stated that Parasite was his favorite movie of 2019, and whie that's all well and good, the film practically exists to ridicule people like him.… Expand\n"", '\n\n            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nIt is an art and full of mysteries that will always keep you busy wondering what will happen next.

It is amazing how the film can change so much from beginning to end without realizing it, and when we notice it, we are already very euphoric waiting for future events. The film is full of super well done scenes. It is usually a discreet angle of the camera that gives us the view of grandeur or claustrophobia. The perfect montage along with the soundtrack, which causes us a lot of anxiety and magnifies the main characters' wooden face, or a big turnaround in the script, containing once again, a montage, soundtrack and performances collaborating so that the scene is quite harmonious . I never thought I'd be in any doubt if I hoped someone would do well or badly in the story.
